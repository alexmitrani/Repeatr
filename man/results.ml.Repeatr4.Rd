\details{
This model was estimated with mlogit on all of the data.

The utility formula was as follows:

choice ~ yearsold_1 + yearsold_2 + yearsold_3 + yearsold_4 + yearsold_5 + yearsold_6 + yearsold_7 + yearsold_8 + song2 + ... + song92

This model was estimated with mlogit on only the data for the other songs of each show, that is all the songs after the first song.

The utility formula was as follows:

choice ~ choice ~ choice ~ yearsold_1 + yearsold_2 + yearsold_3 + yearsold_4 + yearsold_5 + yearsold_6 + yearsold_7 + yearsold_8 + song2 + ... + song92

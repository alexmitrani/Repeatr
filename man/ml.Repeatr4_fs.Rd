}
\usage{
ml.Repeatr4_fs
}
\description{
This model was estimated on only the data for the first song of each show.
}
\details{
Songs that were never ever played as the first song of a Fugazi song were excluded, by necessity.

The utility formula was as follows:

choice ~ yearsold_1 + yearsold_2 + yearsold_3 + song2 + ... + song92

Where yearsold_3 = yearsold_3 + yearsold_4 + yearsold_5 + yearsold_6 + yearsold_7 + yearsold_8

Other song choice model
}
\details{
This model was estimated with mlogit on only the data for the other songs of each show, that is all the songs after the first song.

The utility formula was as follows:

choice ~ choice ~ choice ~ yearsold_1 + yearsold_2 + yearsold_3 + yearsold_4 + yearsold_5 + yearsold_6 + yearsold_7 + yearsold_8 + song2 + ... + song92

\description{
This was originally developed with a file called "fugotcha.csv", the first line of which went like this:

washington-dc-usa-90387	FLS0001	03/09/1987	Wilson Center	$5	300	Joey Picuri	Fugazi	Cassette	Joe #1	Intro	Song #1	Furniture	Merchandise	Turn Off Your Guns	In Defense Of Humans	Waiting Room	The Word

"gid" is short for "gig id"

Another data file that was used was called "releases_songs_durations_wikipedia.csv" and was obtained from the Wikipedia data on the Fugazi discography.

This file contains the following variables: index	releaseid	release	track_number	songid	song	instrumental	vocals_picciotto	vocals_mackaye	vocals_lally	duration_seconds
}
\examples{
fugotcha <- system.file("extdata", "fugotcha.csv", package = "Repeatr")
releases_songs_durations_wikipedia <- system.file("extdata", "releases_songs_durations_wikipedia.csv", package = "Repeatr")
releasesdatafile <- system.file("extdata", "releases_rym.csv", package = "Repeatr")
Repeatr_1_results <- Repeatr_1(mycsvfile = fugotcha, mysongdatafile = releases_songs_durations_wikipedia, releasesdatafile = releasesdatafile)

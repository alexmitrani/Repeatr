\description{
some of this data was scraped from the Fugazi Live Series website by Carni Klirs for his project "Visualizing the History of Fugazi".
The original data on coordinates, cities and tours data came from The D-I-Y Data of Fugazi by Matthew Conlen.
Rows with checked==1 were updated by Alex Mitrani, in particular making sure that the coordinates indicated the actual locations of the venues for city-level mapping.

\title{Tests whether differences between pairs of model parameters are significant or not.}
\usage{
diffr(mymodel = NULL, coefindex1 = NULL, coefindex2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mymodel}{model to be used.}

\item{coefindex1}{index number of first coefficient to be tested}

\item{coefindex2}{index number of second coefficient to be tested}
}
\value{

}
\description{
The function finds the standard error of the difference between the two coefficients in terms of their variances and their covariance: myse <- (sqrt(myvar1 + myvar2 - 2*mycov))

It then proceeds to calculate a z-statistic: myz <- (mycoefdiff)/myse

A z-statistic of 1.96 or greater would indicate that the difference between the coefficients is significant at the 95\% level of confidence.

mytest <- diffr(mymodel = ml.Repeatr4, coefindex1 = 1, coefindex2 = 2)

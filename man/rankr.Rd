\title{Undertakes paired comparisons for ranking a set of coefficients, considering whether the differences between the coefficients are significant or not.}
\usage{
rankr(coeftable = NULL, vcovmat = NULL, mysongidlist = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{coeftable}{coefficients table from mlogit, with one row per coefficient}

\item{vcovmat}{variance covariance matrix from mlogit, with one row and one column per coefficient}

\item{mysongidlist}{a dataframe containing the list of song ids to be tested.  It can contain other variables but only songid will be used.}
}
\description{
The index numbers are based on the model coefficient table that comes straight out of the model, with no sorting.

The function will return a dataframe with the results for each pair of coeeficients tested.

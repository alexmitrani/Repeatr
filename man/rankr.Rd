\usage{
rankr(mymodel = NULL, mysongidlist = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mymodel}{the choice model to be used}

\item{mysongidlist}{a dataframe containing the list of song ids to be tested.  It can contain other variables but only songid will be used.}
}
\value{

}
\description{
The index numbers are based on the model coefficient table that comes straight out of the model, with no sorting.

The function will return a dataframe with the results for each pair of coeeficients tested.

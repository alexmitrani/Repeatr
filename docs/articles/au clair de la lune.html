<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>Two Beats Off was debuted as an instrumental at the 40 Watt in
Athens, Georgia on 3 May1989. The first rendition with lyrics was at the
9:30 Club in Washington DC on 20 July 1989. This show seems to be the
source of the photo by Jim Saah that featured on the cover of Repeater,
the album on which Two Beats Off got it’s official release on 19 April
1990. Fugazi played Two Beats Off at least 371 times with the last
recorded version being on the 6 July 2001 in Victoria, BC, Canada.</p>

of these involve taking through force or some other form of exertion
something which is not freely given. The way the word trophy is used

<p>‘Got a new technique’ speaks to recent developments, perhaps
newsworthy events at the time the song was written. Scandals and how
people or organisations with money and power adapted to manage them.</p>
<p>Something broken but not cleaned up or fixed, just normalised and
made to look like there is nothing wrong. “Move along, there is nothing
to see here”.</p>
<p>In particular, this bit makes me think of pedophile priests and how
they were dealt with by the church. In 1990 there was a TV documentary
drama film called ‘Judgement’ about the case of a pedophile priest in
Louisiana that first made headlines in 1985 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chicagotribune1990" role="doc-biblioref">Chicago Tribune

<p>In many cases church authorities tried to deal with cases of abuse as
an internal matter, not reporting the alleged crimes to the police and
moving the offenders to other locations where they could continue
abusing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The release of about 6,000 pages of documents provided a grim
backstage look at the scandal, graphically detailing the patterns of
serial abuse by dozens of priests who were systematically rotated to new
assignments as church officials kept criminal behavior secret from civil
authority. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-editorialboard2013" role="doc-biblioref">Editorial Board 2013</a>)</span></p>

</h2>
<p>Two Beats Off probably has more live variations than any other Fugazi
song, at least in terms of the use of samples of other songs and
variations to the main lyrics of the song. On several occasions the
intro to Two Beats Off contained parts of several other songs threaded
together. To reduce repetition of the same lines over and over again,
the summary of each rendition will focus on the parts that are
different, omitting lines that are the same as elsewhere.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="fls0105-athens-ga-usa-531989">FLS0105 Athens, GA USA 5/3/1989<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fls0105-athens-ga-usa-531989"></a>
</h3>
<p>The music of Two Beats Off was performed as an instrumental, and it
seems that at this time the song did not have a title, it was introduced
by Ian MacKaye as “and now, part two of this great instrumental” (part
one was Joe #1) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1989" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1989a</a>)</span>. This rendition is an
important starting point for a detailed look at the song because the
absence of vocal part and lyrics gives clues about when these might have
been written.</p>

</h3>
<p>By the time of this show at the 9:30 Club, Two Beats Off had been
named and had vocals with an initial set of lyrics. The sound-quality is
rated ‘poor’ and there are parts where something is being sung that I
couldn’t make out, but from what I could hear, this initial version had
only a limited set of lyrics and used a lot of repetition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cut my nails to the quick</p>
<p>but still I was caught with my hand in the till</p>
<p>red-handed x 2</p>
<p>you want it? you gotta pick it up x 3</p>

<p>If the information on Wikipedia is correct, recording for Repeater
finished in September 1989 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wikipediacontributors2024b" role="doc-biblioref">Wikipedia
Contributors 2024b</a>)</span>. If that is right the lyrics used on the
album version had already been written and sung but were not used in
their entirety on this occasion. This rendition at Maxwell’s featured
lyrics close to the album version, but not the same. In particular, the
lines about something, anything, everything and security / privilege
were omitted. ‘Body sweating’ appears as an alternative to ‘trophy
swelling’.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fingers reaching</p>
<p>body sweating <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1989b" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1989c</a>)</span></p>

</h3>
<p>This rendition features lyrics that are very close to the album
version, but still with a few variations, here for instance there is
taking instead of ‘give me’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>taking</p>
<p>taking everything <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1989c" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1989d</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This performance also features love instead of money:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve got a new technique</p>
<p>love will make the pieces fit where they fall <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1989c" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi
1989d</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What might be a new technique is to have lots of interchangeable
parts and vary them with every rendition - it is hard to find any two
live renditions of this song that are the same, and it is also a
challenge to find a live version with exactly the same lyrics as the
album version.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Unusually, this intro to Two Beats Off is sung by Ian MacKaye. This
is from an old gospel song that has been performed by many artists
including Louis Armstrong, Screamin’ Jay Hawkins, Sam Cooke, B. B. King,
and Joan Baez, who sang it at Woodstock in 1969 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wikipediacontributors2024a" role="doc-biblioref">Wikipedia Contributors 2024c</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Following on from this, Guy Picciotto takes up the lead vocals with a
few lines that are clearly based on ‘The Place I Love’ by The Jam <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thejam1978" role="doc-biblioref">The Jam
1978</a>)</span>, with a few changes to wording and sequence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The place I love is nowhere near here</p>
<p>Not within a mile of those trendy do’s</p>
<p>Beautiful moss and colourful flowers</p>
<p>Let’s take a stand against the world <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1990b" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi
1990d</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main part of the song features some lines that did not make it
into the album version but feature in many live renditions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you want it?</p>
<p>you gotta pick it up</p>
<p>and take it</p>
<p>up against the wall <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1990b" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi

</blockquote>
<p>The end of the song also features Ian MacKaye, who sings something
that sounds like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he got in</p>
<p>and disappeared</p>
<p>he got here</p>
<p>and disappeared <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1990b" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1990d</a>)</span></p>

<p>The rendition of Two Beats Off at the King’s Arms in Herne Bay is
introduced by a playful mash-up of Elvis and Gershwin:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The reference to ‘blue suede shoes’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-presley1956" role="doc-biblioref">Presley 1956</a>)</span>
was a one-off because Guy found a sheet of paper with the lyrics of the

<p>On 7 November 1990 Fugazi and The Ex played a benefit for Steunpunt
Zetten (support point Zetten) at Paradiso in Amsterdam, Netherlands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m sure most of you know this is a benefit, and for a very important
cause indeed. In Washington DC we have similar problems with youth care,
everybody’s children think other children are crazy apparently, and they
put them away in little psychiatric prisons where they are mistreated,
abused, molested… So, anyway, I think it is a rather worthy cause. - Ian
MacKaye, 7 November 1990 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1990" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1990e</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steunpunt Zetten was a support group and activist group working on
behalf of young people who complained that they suffered abuse of
various kinds from a psychiatrist in charge of the residential youth
care institution (Heldringstichting) in Zetten. Complaints were
originally published in 1974 but it took until 1990 for the psychiatrist
Theo Finkensieper to be investigated, charged and sentenced to 6 years
in prison. He was sentenced on 30 May 1990. Finkensieper’s appeal was
heard in October 1990 and rejected. ‘When Steunpunt Zetten sought
publicity from 24 April 1990, other reports of sexual abuse within youth
care institutions came in almost immediately, such as in the youth care
institution De Dreef in Wapenveld, where there was sexual abuse of boys.
Ultimately, seven employees were also convicted here in 1993’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vanderlans2012" role="doc-biblioref">Lans 2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Guy Picciotto sang something in French as part of an extended
introduction to Two Beats Off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Au clair de la lune</p>
<p>Je suis tombé dans l’eau</p>
<p>Ça se fait des bulles</p>
<p>C’est très rigolo</p>
<p>Voilà mon amour</p>
<p>Avec des ciseaux</p>
<p>Elle va couper mon coeur</p>
<p>En trois mille morceaux<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1990" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1990e</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a modified version of a rude nursery rhyme <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bouteloup2003" role="doc-biblioref">Bouteloup 2003</a>)</span> that is sang to the tune
of an older, traditional 18th century folk song. The folk song has many
innuendos or ‘sexual undertones’ and is the subject of the oldest known
audio recording (1860) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wikipediacontributors2024" role="doc-biblioref">Wikipedia
Contributors 2024a</a>)</span>. Compared to the rude nursery rhyme, Guy
mainly changed the second verse, what he sings is “Here is my love /
with scissors / she is going to cut my heart / into three thousand
pieces”, whereas in the nursery rhyme it translates roughly as “My
grandmother is coming / with scissors / she cuts my buttocks / in three
thousand pieces” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bouteloup2003" role="doc-biblioref">Bouteloup 2003</a>)</span>. Guy Picciotto wasn’t
the first punk rocker to have made use of “au clare de la lune” -
Siouxsie Sioux sang the first verse or two (in French) in ‘The Lord’s
Prayer’ (1979) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-siouxsieandthebanshees1979" role="doc-biblioref">Siouxsie and
Banshees 1979</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>On this occasion Guy also made significant changes to the lyrics of
the song, making it into more of a protest song.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you want it?</p>
<p>you’ve got to pick it up</p>
<p>then take it</p>
<p>out into the streets</p>
<p>the fingers reaching</p>
<p>your heart is breaking</p>
<p>my friends</p>
<p>take it to the streets <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1990" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1990e</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The extended introduction that was added to Two Beats Off made me
wonder why this was done, and in particular it got me thinking that
maybe there was a connection between Two Beats Off and the nature of
this particular benefit concert. It wouldn’t be the first time that
something special had been performed by Fugazi at a benefit concert -
Guy commented in an interview <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-picciotto2021" role="doc-biblioref">Picciotto and Niceley
2021</a>)</span> that ‘Give Me The Cure’ was written for and performed
for the first time at a benefit for AIDS research at Columbia University
in New York <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1988" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1988</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>“Au clair de la lune” from the earliest versions in the 18th century
seems to have hidden sexual innuendos but nevertheless it is considered
a song for children. The rude nursery rhyme that is sung to the same
tune as the original juxtaposes childish activities with violent
punishment. Guy’s version takes the rude nursery rhyme and makes it more
romantic, or at least sexual, but no less violent - here comes my lover,
with scissors, to cut my heart in three thousand pieces.</p>

<p>A series of potentially relevant news stories was published at around
the time Two Beats Off was in the process of being written. As seen in
the summaries of live performances, this song went on evolving after the
album version had been published and almost every performance was
different in some way from previous versions.</p>
<p>One particular person, the DC area Catholic priest George Augustus
Stallings Jr., seems to embody many of the themes of the song. It is not
possible to say for sure that this person was a subject of the song but
there are many aspects of his story that seem to coincide with parts of
the song, especially considering some of the variations that were
performed live.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stallings, 41, a convert to Catholicism, attracted national attention
as pastor of St. Teresa of Avila parish in Southeast Washington by
melding the gospel music and preaching and worship styles familiar to
blacks with the traditional mass. According to the priest, in his 12
years at St. Teresa's, membership increased from 200 to 2,000. - The
Washington Post, 1989-06-20. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hyer1989" role="doc-biblioref">Hyer 1989</a>)</span></p>
<p>The Rev. George A. Stallings Jr., the dissident Catholic priest, went
on national television yesterday to say that he is innocent of the
allegation that he had sex with a 16-year-old altar boy. “Read my lips:
I am innocent,” Stallings said on CNN’s “Larry King Live.” Stallings
went on to say, “What else do you want to know?” but declined to answer
questions. He would not say if he has ever had sex with a minor or any
man. He also would not state his views on pedophilia or the vow of
celibacy. The Washington Post reported Monday that the former altar boy,
now 28, swore in a signed statement that he repeatedly had sexual
relations with the priest in the rectory of St. Teresa of Avila Catholic
Church in Southeast Washington in a three- to four-month period in 1977.
The man, whom The Post agreed not to identify, said he broke off the
relationship and never reported it to authorities. The Post also
reported that the Archdiocese of Washington had received a separate
complaint three years ago but had not been able to substantiate it. This
summer, The Post reported, Cardinal James A. Hickey confronted Stallings
about his lifestyle and asked him to seek treatment at a church-owned
facility specializing in treating pedophilia. Soon after the meeting
with Hickey, Stallings defied church authorities by founding the Imani
Temple, an independent black Catholic congregation. He said he was
prompted by racism in the church. - The Washington Post, 1989-09-06.
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dedman1989" role="doc-biblioref">Dedman 1989</a>)</span></p>
<p>…overall, a cover-up pattern persists. Too often, bishops have simply
recycled accused priests to a new parish, while the afflicted families
were held at arm’s length. Because judges have sealed the records of
many civil settlements, there is no way to know exactly how much has
been paid. But there are clear signs of heavy losses. In a Minneapolis
case, the plaintiff’s sister testified that he had rejected a
$1.5-million offer. The plaintiff’s attorney, Jeffrey Anderson of
St. Paul, says he has 30 suits pending for other clients, involving 16
priests in seven states. One Louisiana diocese and its insurers have
paid $15 million to victims of a parish priest. In all at least $30
million is known to have been paid nationwide. - The Washington Post,
1989-09-16. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-berry1989" role="doc-biblioref">Berry 1989</a>)</span></p>
<p>In the summer of 1985, a Roman Catholic priest named George Augustus
Stallings Jr. bought his independence for $60,000 and named it Augustus
Manor. The 80-year-old house, just up the hill from his St. Teresa of
Avila Church, didn’t look like much. But in the next two years Stallings
restored it and adorned it with European and Oriental antiques, a
Japanese garden and an Italian marble bathroom. The “jewel of
Anacostia,” as Washingtonian magazine called Augustus Manor, became a
sign of Stallings’s success as a parish priest and a preacher of
national renown. His congregation was on its way to a tenfold increase
in membership, a major renovation of its historic sanctuary and a
leading role in the adaptation of Roman Catholicism for black believers.
But Augustus Manor was more than a symbol. It was an act of defiance:
Cardinal James A. Hickey, the archbishop of Washington, has a firm rule
that parish priests live in rectories. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dedman1990" role="doc-biblioref">Dedman and Sessions Stepp
1990</a>)</span></p>
<p>Church officials said they were aware, for example, that since 1979
there had been scattered complaints from some parishioners at St. Teresa
who questioned Stallings’s stewardship of church funds. When Stallings
bought Augustus Manor and began renovating it, some parishioners raised
questions as to how he could afford it on his $10,000 salary, according
to a church official. Stallings has said he paid for the renovation with
his earnings from preaching revivals around the country. Documents
reviewed by The Washington Post show that Stallings wrote a $4,478 check
on a St. Teresa account for a cedar fence that surrounds Augustus Manor.
Parish lay leaders and archdiocesan officials said recently they did not
know of any expenditure of parish funds for the priest’s home. A
spokesman for Stallings declined to say why Stallings used the parish
account or whether he reimbursed St. Teresa. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dedman1990" role="doc-biblioref">Dedman and Sessions Stepp
1990</a>)</span></p>
<p>Brown, now 25, said he and Stallings, 42, were lovers for the next
two years, during which time he lived in Augustus Manor, the priest’s
house in Anacostia. For nine months of that time, Stallings employed
Brown as a pastoral assistant at St. Teresa of Avila parish. Brown and
other employees said that much of the time he was out of the parish on
trips with Stallings. Brown and Stallings were consenting adults, but
Stallings was sworn to celibacy in a church that considers homosexual
activity a sin. Brown said Stallings knew parishioners were whispering
about their relationship. “It bothered him, but all people could do was
insinuate,” Brown said. “He didn’t think it would catch up with him.” -
The Washington Post, 1990-04-30. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sessionsstepp1990" role="doc-biblioref">Sessions Stepp and
Dedman 1990</a>)</span></p>
<p>Although Hickey couldn’t establish whether Stallings was breaking his
vow of celibacy, he could see that Stallings was breaking another vow -
of obedience. In 1987, for instance, Stallings hired without permission
a priest who had been suspended from his order in another city because
of allegations that he made sexual advances to teenage boys. It is
unclear what disturbed Hickey most about Stallings: the questions about
his homosexual activity or his repeated challenges in many areas to the
bishop’s authority. After years of such challenges, Hickey last summer
gave Stallings an ultimatum. In a dramatic confrontation, according to
Stallings, Hickey ordered him to seek psychiatric treatment for an
“excessive ego” at a church hospital known for treating priests with
sexual disorders. - The Washington Post, 1990-04-30. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sessionsstepp1990" role="doc-biblioref">Sessions Stepp and Dedman 1990</a>)</span></p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#discussion"></a>
</h2>
<p>I had literally heard this song hundreds of times and it never made
much sense to me until the “au clair de la lune” introduction grabbed my
attention and made me wonder why this had been added as an introduction.
The benefit for victims of sexual abuse by a psychiatrist at a
children’s home made me wonder if Two Beats Off might be about similar
cases of abuse and seen from this point of view the meaning of the
lyrics seemed to become much clearer.</p>
<p>It is notable how Two Beats Off is sung in the first person as if the
singer is playing a role in a film or a work of theatre. It isn’t the
only Fugazi song that uses this device of playing a role, the other one
that immediately comes to mind is Suggestion, where the use of a female
point of view alerts the singer is representing someone else. Another
one is perhaps Give Me The Cure. In the case of Two Beats Off the effect
is more subtle and it took me a long time to notice it.</p>
<p>It seems likely that one of the subjects of this song was sexual
abuse by priests and how these crimes were covered up by church
authorities. This had already become a scandal in the US at the time the
song was written, although the scandal grew much bigger over the
following years and broadened in scope to other countries around the
world.</p>
<p>Much of the content can be readily adapted to deal with other types
of abuse in the context of institutions, as seems to have been done in
the case of the 7 November 1990 benefit show at the Paradiso in
Amsterdam, when the special extended introduction made Two Beats Off a
highlight of the show. Two Beats Off was already an established song in
the Fugazi repertoire at this point, so while it wasn’t written for this
show it seems likely that the introduction was added as a way of making
it more specific to the occasion.</p>
<p>Two Beats Off was previously featured on the Alphabetical Fugazi
podcast <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wright2022" role="doc-biblioref">Wright, Rickard, and Rickard 2022</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusion"></a>
</h2>
<p>To me, Two Beats Off seems to be a song about sexual abuse in
institutions, and how it tends to get covered up. I reached this
conclusion after having listened to the song hundreds of times so it was
not too obvious. It took a few significant clues for me to see it from
the right point of view but once I did the lyrics seemed to become quite
clear.</p>

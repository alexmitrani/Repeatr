<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>Two Beats Off was debuted as an instrumental at the 40 Watt in
Athens, Georgia on 3 May1989. The first rendition with lyrics was at the
9:30 Club in Washington DC on 20 July 1989. This show seems to be the
source of the photo by Jim Saah that featured on the cover of Repeater,
the album on which Two Beats Off got it’s official release on 19 April
1990. Fugazi played Two Beats Off at least 371 times with the last
recorded version being on the 6 July 2001 in Victoria, BC, Canada. One
rendition in particular caught my attention more than any of the
others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m sure most of you know this is a benefit, and for a very important
cause indeed. In Washington DC we have similar problems with youth care,
everybody’s children think other children are crazy apparently, and they
put them away in little psychiatric prisons where they are mistreated,
abused, molested… So, anyway, I think it is a rather worthy cause. - Ian
MacKaye, 7 November 1990 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1990" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1990b</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 7 November 1990 Fugazi and The Ex played a benefit for Steunpunt
Zetten (support point Zetten) at Paradiso in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
Steunpunt Zetten was a support group and activist group working on
behalf of young people who complained that they suffered abuse of
various kinds from a psychiatrist in charge of the residential youth
care institution (Heldringstichting) in Zetten. Complaints were
originally published in 1974 but it took until 1990 for the psychiatrist
Theo Finkensieper to be investigated, charged and sentenced to 6 years
in prison. He was sentenced on 30 May 1990. Finkensieper’s appeal was
heard in October 1990 and rejected. ‘When Steunpunt Zetten sought
publicity from 24 April 1990, other reports of sexual abuse within youth
care institutions came in almost immediately, such as in the youth care
institution De Dreef in Wapenveld, where there was sexual abuse of boys.
Ultimately, seven employees were also convicted here in 1993’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vanderlans2012" role="doc-biblioref">Lans 2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Guy Picciotto sang something in French as part of an extended
introduction to Two Beats Off <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1990" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi
1990b</a>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Au clair de la lune</p>
<p>Je suis tombé dans l’eau</p>
<p>Ça se fait des bulles</p>
<p>C’est très rigolo</p>
<p>Voilà mon amour</p>
<p>Avec des ciseaux</p>
<p>Elle va couper mon coeur</p>
<p>En trois mille morceaux</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a modified version of a rude nursery rhyme <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bouteloup2003" role="doc-biblioref">Bouteloup 2003</a>)</span> that is sang to the tune
of an older, traditional 18th century folk song. The folk song has many
innuendos or ‘sexual undertones’ and is the subject of the oldest known
audio recording (1860) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wikipediacontributors2024" role="doc-biblioref">Wikipedia
Contributors 2024</a>)</span>. Compared to the rude nursery rhyme, Guy
mainly changed the second verse, what he sings is “Here is my love /
with scissors / she is going to cut my heart / into three thousand
pieces”, whereas in the nursery rhyme it translates roughly as “My
grandmother is coming / with scissors / she cuts my buttocks / in three
thousand pieces” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bouteloup2003" role="doc-biblioref">Bouteloup 2003</a>)</span>. Guy Picciotto wasn’t
the first punk rocker to have made use of “au clare de la lune” -
Siouxsie Sioux sang the first verse or two (in French) in ‘The Lord’s
Prayer’ (1979) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-siouxsieandthebanshees1979" role="doc-biblioref">Siouxsie and
Banshees 1979</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The extended introduction that was added to Two Beats Off made me
wonder why this was done, and in particular it got me thinking that
maybe there was a connection between Two Beats Off and the nature of
this particular benefit concert. It wouldn’t be the first time that
something special had been performed by Fugazi at a benefit concert -
Guy commented in an interview <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-picciotto2021" role="doc-biblioref">Picciotto and Niceley
2021</a>)</span> that ‘Give Me The Cure’ was written for and performed
for the first time at a benefit for AIDS research at Columbia University
in New York <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1988" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1988</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>‘Got a new technique’ speaks to recent developments, perhaps

made to look like there is nothing wrong. “Move along, there is nothing

<p>In particular, this bit makes me think of pedophile priests and how
they were dealt with by the church. In 1990 there was a TV documentary
drama film called ‘Judgement’ about the case of a pedophile priest in
Louisiana that first made headlines in 1985 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chicagotribune1990" role="doc-biblioref">Chicago Tribune

<p>In many cases church authorities tried to deal with cases of abuse as
an internal matter, not reporting the alleged crimes to the police and
moving the offenders to other locations where they could continue
abusing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The release of about 6,000 pages of documents provided a grim
backstage look at the scandal, graphically detailing the patterns of
serial abuse by dozens of priests who were systematically rotated to new
assignments as church officials kept criminal behavior secret from civil
authority. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-editorialboard2013" role="doc-biblioref">Editorial Board 2013</a>)</span></p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#discussion"></a>
</h2>
<p>I had literally heard this song hundreds of times and it never made
much sense to me until the “au clair de la lune” introduction grabbed my
attention and made me wonder why this had been added as an introduction.
The benefit for victims of sexual abuse by a psychiatrist at a
children’s home made me wonder if Two Beats Off might be about similar
cases of abuse and seen from this point of view the meaning of the
lyrics seemed to become much clearer.</p>
<p>I strongly suspect this song was written mainly about sexual abuse by
priests and how these crimes were covered up by the church. This had
already become a scandal in the US at the time the song was written,
although the scandal grew much bigger over the following years and
broadened in scope to other countries around the world.</p>
<p>However, much of the content can be readily adapted to deal with
other types of abuse in the context of institutions, as was done in the
case of the 7 November 1990 benefit show at the Paradiso in Amsterdam,
when the special extended introduction made Two Beats Off a centrepiece
of the show. Two Beats Off was already an established song in the Fugazi
repertoire at this point, so while it wasn’t written for this show it
seems likely that the introduction was added as a way of making it more
specific to the occasion.</p>
<p>“Au clair de la lune” from the earliest versions in the 18th century
seems to have hidden sexual innuendos but nevertheless it is considered
a song for children. The rude nursery rhyme that is sung to the same
tune as the original juxtaposes childish activities with violent
punishment. Guy’s version takes the rude nursery rhyme and makes it more
romantic, or at least sexual, but no less violent - here comes my lover,
with scissors, to cut my heart in three thousand pieces.</p>
<p>At the Paradiso show Guy also made significant changes to the lyrics
of the song, making it into more of a protest song.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you want it?</p>
<p>you’ve got to pick it up</p>
<p>then take it</p>
<p>out into the streets</p>
<p>the fingers reaching</p>
<p>your heart is breaking</p>
<p>my friends</p>
<p>take it to the streets</p>
<p><span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1990" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1990b</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two Beats Off was previously featured on the Alphabetical Fugazi
podcast <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wright2022" role="doc-biblioref">Wright, Rickard, and Rickard 2022</a>)</span>,
where the discussion was quite different.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusion"></a>
</h2>
<p>To me, Two Beats Off seems to be a song about sexual abuse. I reached
this conclusion after having listened to the song hundreds of times so
it was not too obvious. It took a few significant clues for me to see it
from the right point of view but once I did the lyrics seemed to become
quite clear. Looking at it now, I wonder what took me so long. This
makes me wonder whether there are other Fugazi songs that are like this,
like puzzles waiting to be solved.</p>

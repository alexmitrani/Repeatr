<p>Nice New Outfit is the third track on Fugazi’s Steady Diet of Nothing
album which was recorded at Inner Ear studios in January 1991 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1991" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi
1991b</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Judging from the dates of debut live performances in the Fugazi Live
Series, the songs on Steady Diet of Nothing were written at different
times in a period of about 3 years and 3 months, from October 1987 to
January 1991.</p>

<p>On the 12th January 1991 the US Congress authorized the use of force
to eject Iraq from Kuwait, and ‘Operation Desert Storm’ started on the
16th of January with US warplanes attacking targets in Iraq and Kuwait
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-instituteofmedicine1997" role="doc-biblioref">Institute of Medicine 1997</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Fugazi played at a protest at Lafayette Park, in front of the White
House, on the 12th January 1991:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The timing of this was unbelievable. Suddenly, they’d set a date to
bomb Iraq, and the date we had the permit for the park was a couple of
days before it,” recalled Ian MacKaye, frontman of Fugazi, the
headliners of the show. The city’s punk dissenters arrived en masse,
braving bracing temperatures. “Not only was it cold, but it was raining
and snowing. It was a miserable day, and yet thousands of people came
out. It was a pretty incredible show.” - Ian MacKaye <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-anderson2015" role="doc-biblioref">Anderson 2015</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Fugazi show in front of the White House did not include either
Nice New Outfit or Polish, and neither had been performed previously,
suggesting that those songs probably hadn’t been finished yet. The White
House protest show and the apparent reference to laser-guided bombs in
Nice New Outfit strongly suggest that both Polish and Nice New Outfit
were still being worked on when the Gulf war had already started,
perhaps while Fugazi were in the studio at Inner Ear recording the
album. Given that the album was recorded in January 1991 this narrows
down the period in which these 2 songs were probably finished to the
last 19 days of January. It seems highly likely that the unfolding
events of the US involvement in the Gulf war may have influenced those
two songs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[a]s the Gulf War went well for the US, initial public skepticism
became what Rollins called ‘getting high on war’ - a virus that infected
even the punk scene. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-andersen2009" role="doc-biblioref">M. Andersen and Jenkins 2009</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The debut performance of Nice New Outfit was at Twisters in Richmond,
VA on the 20 of February 1991 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1991a" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1991c</a>)</span>,
where there was some conflict:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a Fugazi show at a club in Richmond, Virginia, Positive Force
activists handing out anti-war fliers were physically intimidated and
nearly ejected from the premises; only the band’s intervention stopped
the confrontation. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-andersen2013" role="doc-biblioref">M. Andersen 2013</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The show featured some comments about the war in the interlude
between And The Same and KYEO:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reaction… we saw it coming six months ago, hardly a reaction, saw it
a year ago, saw it coming a long long time away, nothing we could do
about it, yeah, I’m talking about that um, that war, you’ve all heard
about it I’m sure. There are people who would believe, who would tell
you that if you’re opposed to war, then that meant that you were trying
to undermine or betray the people who happen to be over there, but don’t
let people bullshit you, if you’re opposed to the war, be opposed to the
war, it’s a good thing to be, who wants to be killed? - Ian MacKaye
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1991a" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1991c</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice New Outfit was played a total of 114 times, which was more than
Steady Diet and Polish, but less than all of the other songs on Steady
Diet of Nothing.</p>
<p>Much of the song sounds like it is addressed to someone and here it
is considered whether this might have been a specific person and if so,
who that person might have been.</p>
<p>Nice New Outfit was discussed on the Alphabetical Fugazi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I always assumed that this song was about someone in the military - I
assumed that this was a military uniform, that was my sort of going
assumption, and I also want to add that I designed clothing for years,
when I lived in New York, so I am also drawn to this because of my
history with garment design and structure, so the fact that this song
actually addresses that and addresses like cut, wide at the shoulders
and trim at the hip, that’s a language I speak, like fluently, but for
some reason the anger attached to that set of phrases and the sentiment,
the general sentiment in this song made me think that it was someone who
was like a killing machine or involved in some sort of, I don’t know,
crimes against humanity or something - Buick Audra <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wright2021" role="doc-biblioref">Wright
and Audra 2021</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Here the lyrics of Nice New Outfit will be used as headings and
commented in detail.</p>

</h3>
<p>It sounds like the person being addressed dresses smartly and might
have recently taken on a new role or made a change, perhaps from one
side to another.</p>
<p>There was a politician who was reported to be shopping for clothes at
around the time the war started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the President’s call came in to Representative Thomas S. Foley,
Democrat of Washington, the Speaker of the House, at 5:30 P.M.,
Mr. Foley was shopping for shirts <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dowd1991" role="doc-biblioref">Dowd 1991</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Foley does not seem to deserve to be the subject of all the
anger expressed in this song as he was consistently against the
resolution on Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-clymer1991" role="doc-biblioref">Clymer
1991</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>People are going to die and it will be your responsibility not mine.
This indicates disassociation between the author and the subject of the
song.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">

</h3>
<p>This probably refers to the way the use of military force in the Gulf
was promoted to the American public, as if many people were going to be
easily convinced. The author does not buy the arguments offered to
support military intervention.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">

</h3>
<p>President W.H. Bush deployed troops in the Persian Gulf region on 9
August 1990, a week after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and by the end
of the year approximately 350,000 US troops had been deployed to the
area - without the authorization of Congress. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-weed2015" role="doc-biblioref">Weed 2015</a>)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a press conference on January 9, 1991, President Bush reinforced
this distinction in response to questions about the use of force
resolution being debated in Congress. He was asked whether he thought he
needed the resolution, and if he lost on it would he feel bound by that
decision. President Bush in response stated: “I don’t think I need it….
I feel that I have the authority to fully implement the United Nations
resolutions.” He added that he felt that he had “the constitutional
authority—many attorneys having so advised me.” On January 12, 1991,
both houses passed the “Authorization for Use of Military Force Against
Iraq Resolution” (P.L. 102-1). <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-weed2015" role="doc-biblioref">Weed 2015</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of military force was eventually authorized by Congress but
it seems likely that the president would have pushed ahead with the
military option even if this authorization had not been granted.</p>
<p>A bedsit is a single-room lodging so a bedsitter’s tour does not go
anywhere or offer anything. This conveys the frustration and
powerlessness of someone railroaded into something they are opposed to -
a war - without being offered any real choice.</p>
<p>“a worthless sightsee of your adventure” probably alludes to the
extensive TV coverage of the war which is also explored in the song
Polish <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1991b" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1991a</a>)</span> and is discussed in more
detail in “polish with a small p” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mitrani2023" role="doc-biblioref">Mitrani
2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>“Your adventure” is similar to “your nice new outfit” and suggests
bitter separation and opposition between the author and the subject of
the song.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="in-your-nice-new-outfit-all-straight-clean-lines--theres-blood-in-your-mouth-dressed-to-the-nines-">In your nice new outfit, all straight clean lines. There’s blood in
your mouth, dressed to the nines.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#in-your-nice-new-outfit-all-straight-clean-lines--theres-blood-in-your-mouth-dressed-to-the-nines-"></a>
</h3>
<p>According to the dictionary, “dressed to the nines” means “to be
wearing fashionable or formal clothes for a special occasion” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cambridgedictionary2023" role="doc-biblioref">Cambridge Dictionary 2023a</a>)</span>. This
suggests civilian clothes.</p>
<p>“all straight clean lines” indicates that everything is nice as tidy,
no disorder - perhaps an allusion to lack of effective protest, dissent
or obstacles in Congress despite a Democrat majority in both
chambers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="youre-number-one-with-a-bullet-thats-money-well-spent">You’re number one with a bullet, that’s money well spent,<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#youre-number-one-with-a-bullet-thats-money-well-spent"></a>
</h3>
<p>“Number One with a Bullet” originates from the Billboard Hot 100
chart where a song at #1 but still rising was marked with a bullet
symbol.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the phrase “number one with a bullet” refers to a Hot 100 innovation,
a small symbol indicating that a song is on its way up. To be “number
one with a bullet” means you’re at the top and still rising, thus not
likely to vacate the penthouse anytime soon. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-giaimo2015" role="doc-biblioref">Giaimo 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the subject is probably someone who is at the top of their
area or on the rise. One possible interpretation would be that this
refers to the person with the top job in the USA - the president.</p>
<p>“number one with a bullet” is probably also a reference to the
context in which the song was probably written - the start of the gulf
war - and the role that the subject played in the events leading up to
the war.</p>
<p>“that’s money well spent” probably refers to donations or
contributions, suggesting that the war would probably be in the
interests of those who supported the subject financially. This strongly
suggests that the subject of the song might be a politician.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="your-mouth-plastered-like-poster-address-yourself-success-">your mouth plastered like poster, address yourself success.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#your-mouth-plastered-like-poster-address-yourself-success-"></a>
</h3>
<p>“your mouth plastered like poster” brings to mind TV broadcasts of
speeches and interviews, specifically walls of TV screens such as those
in shop windows, all the TVs tuned to the same channel, showing someone
making a speech.</p>
<p>“address yourself success” suggests that the subject of the song
might be in it for themselves, their actions motivated by personal
interest and benefit. “address” is used for formal speeches, as in
“address to the nation”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this
new world order, an order in which a credible United Nations can use its
peace-keeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the U.N.’s
founders. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bush1991" role="doc-biblioref">Bush 1991</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“address yourself success” also hints at “dress for success” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-entwistle2023" role="doc-biblioref">Entwistle 2023</a>)</span>, which would link back
to the “nice new outfit” theme.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is also an echo of Dylan here, who sang on Subterranean
Homesick Blues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learn to dance, get dressed Get blessed, try to be a success <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bobdylan1965" role="doc-biblioref">Bob
Dylan 1965</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was one of the first popular songs to be accompanied by a video
(part of a documentary film), in which Dylan shows a series of prompt
cards with words often varying from the lyrics - in the case of
“success” the prompt card says “suck-cess” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pennebaker1967" role="doc-biblioref">Pennebaker
1967</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Laser-guided bombs were initially developed during the Vietnam war
but their first large-scale use was during the Gulf war.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The FLIR also contains a laser “designator” linked to a cross-hair
sight on the pilot’s computer display. To send a 2,000-pound bomb
hurtling through the ventilation shaft of a hardened bunker, a pilot has
only to head his airplane in approximately the right direction, release
his bomb, fix the FLIR cross-hairs on the target, and order his laser
designator to remain locked on the target. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-browne1991" role="doc-biblioref">Browne 1991</a>)</span></p>

</h3>
<p>This line contrasts the “nice new outfit” with “all straight clean
lines” with “mess” as a euphemism for the death and destruction of war.
The apologetic tone is ironic, suggesting that the subject of the song
will keep their distance from the actual violence. “sorry about the
mess” is another hint that the subject of the song is a civilian, not a
member of the military, who would be unlikely to apologize, and for whom
war would not be an “adventure”.</p>

</h3>
<p>This final line drops the restraint and unleashes the underlying
anger expressed in this song. The stark contrast between appearance
(elegance) and substance (a mess) is reminiscent of The Emperor’s New
Clothes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But he hasn’t got anything on!” said a little child. “Lor! Just hark
at the innocent,” said its father. And one whispered to the other what
the child had said: “That little child there says he hasn’t got anything
on.” “Why, he hasn’t got anything on!” the whole crowd was shouting at
last; and the Emperor’s flesh crept, for it seemed to him they were
right. “But all the same,” he thought to himself, “I must go through
with the procession.” So he held himself more proudly than before, and
the lords in waiting walked on bearing the train—the train that wasn’t
there at all. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-andersen1930" role="doc-biblioref">H. C. Andersen 1930</a>)</span></p>

</h2>
<p>If this song is about a specific individual, the person who seems to
fit the description more than anyone else is George H. W. Bush, the 41st
president of the US (1989 - 1993) and the commander in chief of the
armed forces. There are several clues that all point in this
direction:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“The place I’m offered is a bedsitter’s tour, a worthless
sightsee of your adventure” - the president seemed determined to use
military force with or without authorization by Congress</p></li>
<li><p>“number one with a bullet, that’s money well spent” - the
presidency is the top job in the USA, and presidential campaigns require
raising a lot of money which would imply future commitments to donors.
President Bush had links to oil, defense, and intelligence <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baker2013" role="doc-biblioref">Baker
2013</a>)</span>, and his 1988 presidential campaign received
significant support from the NRA <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kopel1996" role="doc-biblioref">Kopel
1996</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>“your mouth plastered like poster, address yourself success” -
seems to allude to the TV broadcast of the presidential address
announcing the start of the war.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the main subject of the song is the president, the meaning of
“nice new outfit” requires some interpretation. Any president can be
expected to be smartly dressed and have extensive resources and support
regarding what they wear and how they present themselves in public. The
president didn’t get a new job or change their role significantly in the
period of interest, and it seems unlikely that they would have started
dressing differently. Perhaps “nice new outfit” should not be taken too
literally.</p>
<p>“You like the cut, you like the fit, wide in the shoulders, trim at
the hips” brings to mind a tailor-made suit, something that is just
right for the subject of the song, just what they wanted, and makes them
look good. This could be an allusion to the joint resolution that was
passed on the 12th of January authorizing President Bush to use military
force in the Persian Gulf. This resolution gave the president everything
they needed to start the war without risking significant domestic
resistance such as protests. Understood in this way, “nice new outfit”
broadens the focus of the song making it critical not just of the
president but also of everyone who contributed to the military action
being authorized. Both House and Senate resolutions were sponsored and
voted for by both Democrats and Republicans, and the Democrats had
majorities in both chambers <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-clymer1991" role="doc-biblioref">Clymer 1991</a>)</span>. The
significant bipartisan support for the war in Congress hints at a double
meaning considering another, informal meaning of “outfit” - “an
organization, company, team, military unit, etc.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cambridgedictionary2023a" role="doc-biblioref">Cambridge Dictionary 2023b</a>)</span></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusion"></a>
</h2>
<p>Nice New Outfit is essentially an anti-war protest song, probably
written at a similar time to Polish in late January 1991, when the Gulf
War was unfolding. The subject referred to as “you” in the song is
probably President George H. W. Bush. The “nice new outfit” is probably
a metaphorical reference to support for the war in general and in
particular the bi-partisan support that gave President Bush the
authorization from Congress for his military “adventure” in the Gulf,
despite Democrat majorities in both chambers.</p>

</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://alexmitrani.shinyapps.io/Repeatr-app/" class="external-link">Repeatr-app</a>
makes it easy to get some insights and answer questions about the Fugazi
Live Series. It also provides several new ways of finding shows to
listen to. The app has 7 pages which will be described in the following
sections. Each page shows a visualisation (map or graph) and a data
table, with the exception of ‘search’ which only has a data table.</p>
<p>Most of the input boxes are ‘selectize’ controls - when you select
the control a menu will appear, and if you start typing the menu will be
filtered by what you type. You can select any number of items or none at
all. A few of the input boxes are menus where you can only select one
option - these have a little down arrow to the right side of the input
box.</p>
<p>The data for songs is limited to songs that were played live at least
twice in the Fugazi Live Series. That is 92 songs which feature in the
Fugazi discography and one unreleased song - ‘Preprovisional’.</p>
<p>The release dates are best estimates based on the available evidence.
Actual release dates will have varied depending on the location.</p>
<p>The show locations have been determined as closely as possible using
the available evidence. The search started with the information on the
Fugazi Live Series website, including any flyers and comments. Google
Maps would find some places quickly but others would be more difficult -
many of the venues are no longer there. The search was broadened using
sites like setlist.fm, which sometimes had addresses for old venues,
reading online publications, and reaching out to people who might
remember where the venues were located. There may still be “false
positives” - cases where an address was found but the address might be
wrong. Please let me know if you find anything that needs
correcting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="shows">shows<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#shows"></a>
</h2>
<p>The map shows the locations of the Fugazi shows and the table below
the map has some details of each show and a link to the corresponding
page on the <a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series" class="external-link">Fugazi
Live Series</a> site.</p>
<p>The data can be filtered by typing in the selection boxes for years,
tours, countries and cities. When a box is blank it means there is no
filter applied to the data for that variable. The selections apply
sequentially from left to right and from top to bottom. For instance, if
you select a year the remaining menus will be filtered to show only data
for the selected year.</p>
<p>The map has zoom controls and by clicking and dragging you can pan
the map view. The area of the red circle for each show is proportional
to the attendance of the show. If you click on the red circle for a show
a pop-up will appear with the date, the venue, the city and the
attendance.</p>
<p>The timeline slider below the map allows filtering the data by date.
The position of the slider control corresponds to the oldest date of the
selection, so if you move the slider forward from left to right you will
progressively filter out older shows. There are some additional controls
for use together with the timeline slider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>period (weeks) indicates the duration of the selected period in
weeks. It is initially 792 weeks which covers the full duration of the
Fugazi Live Series.</p></li>
<li><p>step (days) indicates the size of each step in days, this is for
use with the fast forward and reverse buttons.</p></li>
<li><p>the ‘map marker’ button will change the period to 1 week and the
step to 1 day, starting at the date selected with the timeline slider.
The idea is that you can then step forward through a tour one day at a
time.</p></li>
<li><p>‘fast-forward’ will move the selection forward in time by one
step</p></li>
<li><p>‘rewind’ will move the selection back in time by one
step</p></li>
<li><p>‘home’ will move the timeline slider back to the beginning and
set the period to 792 weeks again, to select the entire series. It is
recommended to use the home button before changing the selections in the
selection boxes above the map.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The data table below the map and the timeline controls shows summary
data for the selected shows. Each of the following columns can be sorted
using the sort controls to the right of the variable name:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fls_link - a link to the corresponding page of the <a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series" class="external-link">Fugazi Live
Series</a> site</p></li>
<li><p>date</p></li>
<li><p>venue</p></li>
<li><p>city</p></li>
<li><p>country</p></li>
<li><p>attendance</p></li>
<li><p>coordinates - if you copy the coordinates you can display the
location of a show in an online map of your choice.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="tours">tours<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tours"></a>
</h2>
<p>The graph shows the cumulative attendance across the Fugazi Live
Series. The ‘years’ selection box can be used to filter the data to show
only specific years. The colours identify specific tours. The graph is
interactive - if you hover over a point it will display details of the
date, the cumulative attendance and the tour.</p>
<p>The data table shows summary data for the tours. Each of the
following columns can be sorted using the sort controls to the right of
the variable name:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>tour</p></li>
<li><p>start - start date of the tour</p></li>
<li><p>end - end date of the tour</p></li>
<li><p>shows - number of shows</p></li>
<li><p>days - duration of the tour in days</p></li>
<li><p>attendance - total attendance for the tour</p></li>
<li><p>cumulative_attendance - comulative attendance since the start of
the Fugazi Live Series.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="xray">xray<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#xray"></a>
</h2>
<p>The stacked bar graph on this page shows the composition of each show
in terms of the releases on which the songs feature, or whether the
songs were released or not at the time of the show.</p>
<p>The data can be filtered by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>years</p></li>
<li><p>tours</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The filters are applied sequentially from left to right.</p>
<p>The ‘variable’ control offers two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>releases - show how many songs were drawn from each
release</p></li>
<li><p>unreleased - show how many songs were unreleased at the
time</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The data table below the graph provides summary data for each
show:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fls_link - a link to the corresponding page of the <a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series" class="external-link">Fugazi Live
Series</a> site</p></li>
<li><p>date - the date of the show</p></li>
<li><p>songs - the total number of songs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining columns will vary depending on whether the option
selected for ‘variable’ is ‘releases’ or ‘unreleased’. All columns can
be sorted, which makes it easy to find the shows with the most songs,
the most unreleased songs, or the shows with the most songs from a
particular release.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="releases">releases<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#releases"></a>
</h2>
<p>The bar chart shows summary data for each song of each Fugazi
release, sorted in ascending order of release date and track number from
top to bottom.</p>
<p>The data can be filtered for one or more specific releases using the
‘release’ selection box.</p>
<p>The ‘variable’ menu has two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>count - the number of times the song was performed in the Fugazi
Live Series. All else being equal, older songs tend to have higher
counts because they were available in the band’s repertoire for more
shows.</p></li>
<li><p>rate - the number of times the song was performed divided by the
number of shows since the song’s debut. This variable normalizes the
counts by the potential maximum number of performances to give fairer
treatment to newer songs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The data table includes the following columns, all of which can be
sorted:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>release</p></li>
<li><p>first_debut - the date of the first debut from this
release</p></li>
<li><p>last_debut - the date of the last debut from this
release</p></li>
<li><p>release_date - this is an assumption based on the available
evidence. Actual release dates will have been different in different
places.</p></li>
<li><p>songs - number of songs on the release</p></li>
<li><p>count - total number of performances of the songs on the
release</p></li>
<li><p>shows - number of shows at which songs from the release were
performed</p></li>
<li><p>rate - the average of the rates for the songs on the
release</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The counts and the rates give different results if they are used to
rank the releases. Repeater was the album that yielded more live
performances than any other in Fugazi’s catalogue, but The Argument had
the highest performance rate in relation to the number of shows at which
these songs were available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="songs">songs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#songs"></a>
</h2>
<p>The graph shows the cumulative performance counts for each song. The
data can be filtered by the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>years</p></li>
<li><p>tours</p></li>
<li><p>release</p></li>
<li><p>songs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These filters are applied sequentially from left to right and from
top to bottom.</p>
<p>The graph shows a lot of detail on how each song fared across the
live series, including ‘flatline’ periods where songs were not played at
all, and periods of steep growth where songs were played night after
night for significant periods.</p>
<p>The data table offers the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>release</p></li>
<li><p>song</p></li>
<li><p>from - first time performed (within the selected time
period)</p></li>
<li><p>to - last time performed (within the selected time
period)</p></li>
<li><p>released - corresponding release date</p></li>
<li><p>count - number of times performed (within the selected time
period)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dates and performance counts correspond to the selected data, so
these values will change whenever you change the filters for years or
tours.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="transitions">transitions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#transitions"></a>
</h2>
<p>The heatmap shows the number of times each transition was performed.
The graph is interactive - if you hover over a point, a pop-up will
appear showing ‘to’ (song), ‘from’ (song) and ‘count’ - the number of
times the transition was performed.</p>
<p>The data can be filtered by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>years</p></li>
<li><p>tours</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These filters are applied sequentially from left to right. For
instance, if you select 1995 for ‘years’, the ‘tours’ menu will only
show the 1995 tours.</p>
<p>The data table includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>from - the first song in the transition</p></li>
<li><p>to - the second song in the transition</p></li>
<li><p>count - the number of times the transition was performed (within
the selected time period)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="search">search<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#search"></a>
</h2>
<p>Here you can find shows that contain specific songs or specific
transitions between songs.</p>
<p>There are two filters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>from - the first song in the transition</p></li>
<li><p>to - the second song in the transition</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The filters are applied sequentially from left to right, so for
instance if you specify ‘life and limb’ in ‘from’, the menu for ‘to’
will only show songs which followed ‘life and limb’.</p>
<p>Both filters are optional. If only one song is specified shows
containing that song will be listed. If no song is specified all the
shows will be listed.</p>
<p>The data table includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fls_link provides a link to the corresponding page of the <a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series" class="external-link">Fugazi Live
Series</a> site</p></li>
<li><p>date - date of the show</p></li>
<li><p>transition - this is the number of the transition in the set,
where 1 is the first transition in that show. Larger numbers will
indicate that the transition was played later in the set.</p></li>
<li><p>song1 - the first song in the transition</p></li>
<li><p>song2 - the second song in the transition</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks.</p>

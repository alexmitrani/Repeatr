</h2>
<p>Polish is the ninth track on Fugazi’s Steady Diet of Nothing album
which was recorded at Inner Ear studios in January 1991 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1991" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi
1991b</a>)</span> .</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My journals report that I was considering the title ‘Steady Diet’
for a song that had the working title ‘Big Choppy Chord’ in late
February of 1991. That song ended up being ‘Polish’. In March of 1991,
we decided to call the album ‘Steady Diet of Nothing’ and then in April
we decided to include the instrumental and called that ‘Steady Diet.’”
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mackaye2022" role="doc-biblioref">MacKaye 2022</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original title of the track was Steady Diet and it was introduced
as such by Ian MacKaye the second time it was performed, at the
University of Connecticut <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1991a" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi
1991c</a>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“it was i that introduced the song as ‘steady diet’. it was the
original title of the song (i wrote the lyrics), but we decided to use
it for the instrumental that we wrote around the same time. ‘steady diet
of nothing’ was at first just an allusion to television, but the concept
grew in scope while we were writing the songs that ended up becoming the
‘steady diet of nothing’ album.” - Ian MacKaye <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wright2021" role="doc-biblioref">Wright
and Lalonde 2021</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judging from the dates of debut live performances in the Fugazi Live
Series, the songs on Steady Diet of Nothing were written at different
times in a period of about 3 years and 3 months, from October 1987 to
January 1991.</p>

<p>On the 12th January 1991 the US congress authorized the use of force
to eject Iraq from Kuwait, and ‘Operation Desert Storm’ started on the
16th of January with US warplanes attacking targets in Iraq and Kuwait
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-instituteofmedicine1997" role="doc-biblioref">Institute of Medicine 1997</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>On that same day Fugazi played at a protest at Lafayette Park, in
front of the White House:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The timing of this was unbelievable. Suddenly, they’d set a date to
bomb Iraq, and the date we had the permit for the park was a couple of
days before it,” recalled Ian MacKaye, frontman of Fugazi, the
headliners of the show. The city’s punk dissenters arrived en masse,
braving bracing temperatures. “Not only was it cold, but it was raining
and snowing. It was a miserable day, and yet thousands of people came
out. It was a pretty incredible show.” - Ian MacKaye <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-anderson2015" role="doc-biblioref">Anderson 2015</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Fugazi show in front of the White House did not include either
Nice New Outfit or Polish, and neither had been performed previously,
suggesting that those songs probably hadn’t been finished yet. It seems
highly likely that the unfolding events of the US involvement in the
Gulf war may have influenced those two songs, which were probably among
the last songs to be written for the album.</p>
<p>Nice New Outfit contains the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can pinpoint your chimney and drop one down its length. In your
nice new outfit, sorry about the mess <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1991c" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi
1991a</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Laser-guided bombs were initially developed during the Vietnam war
but their first large-scale use was during the Gulf war <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-browne1991" role="doc-biblioref">Browne
1991</a>)</span>. The Alphabetical Fugazi episode on Nice New Outfit
noted the reference to the laser-guided bombs, the context of the Gulf
war, and the way the war was sold to the public <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wright2021a" role="doc-biblioref">Wright
and Audra 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The Gulf war was nicknamed the “video-game war” due to the pervasive
television coverage of bombing raids and targets apparently being
hit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This superiority was exercised by televising the high-end war
technology the US and its allies used during the war. However, in all
this reporting about war, TV provided an extremely limited view of the
fighting. In fact, it was a “bird-view” of the fighting as the Defense
Department supplied most of the video of the air war. Recorded at night
and with night vision equipment, the images resembled a video game
(“Television – The Persian Gulf War”), hence the war being nicknamed –
The Video Game War <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-zigic2023" role="doc-biblioref">Žigić 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The uneasy relationship between war and video games has been an issue
at least since the first Gulf War. At a press conference in February,
1991 General Norman Schwartzkopf felt compelled to remind Americans that
“This [Operation Desert Storm] is not a video game” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stahl2006" role="doc-biblioref">Stahl
2006</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TV presented the Gulf War primarily as entertainment, complete with
dramatic titles, graphics, and music. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kellner1992" role="doc-biblioref">Kellner
1992</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The White House protest show and the apparent reference to
laser-guided bombs in Nice New Outfit strongly suggest that both Polish
and Nice New Outfit were still being worked on when the Gulf war had
already started, perhaps while Fugazi were in the studio at Inner Ear
recording the album. Given that the album was recorded in January 1991
this narrows down the period in which these 2 songs were probably
finished to the last 19 days of January.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="lyrics">Lyrics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lyrics"></a>
</h2>
<p>Here the lyrics of Polish will be used as headings and commented in
detail.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="got-with-the-program-swallowed-it-whole-sugar-made-it-easy-ice-made-it-cold-">Got with the program, swallowed it whole, sugar made it easy, ice
made it cold.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#got-with-the-program-swallowed-it-whole-sugar-made-it-easy-ice-made-it-cold-"></a>
</h3>
<p>This probably refers to the way in which television news was used by
politicians and military leaders to make the case for the US going to
war against Iraq and the way in which many people were easily persuaded.
“Sugar” brings to mind “sugar-coated mindless garbage” from MTV-Get Off
the Air <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-deadkennedys1985" role="doc-biblioref">Dead Kennedys 1985</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>“Ice” could be a seasonal reference as it was probably winter when
the song was written, and perhaps a specific reference to the protest in
front of the White House:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of the hundreds of raucous punk protest concerts organized by
Positive Force, the enduring Washington DC youth activist collective,
only one gave President George HW Bush insomnia and Fugazi
near-frostbite. Called the Punk Percussion Protest and War On Poverty
Not In the Middle East, the now-infamous demonstration was staged
directly in front of the White House on 12 January 1991. Long planned as
a multi-artist rally that would draw attention to homelessness in
America, the event took a hairpin turn as Operation Desert Storm grew
imminent. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-anderson2015" role="doc-biblioref">Anderson 2015</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ice could also refer to forward-looking infrared radar (FLIR), a
guidance system for bombs that requires the sensor to be very cold:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the principal airborne devices used to assist attacks with
Paveway-equipped bombs is the forward-looking, infrared radar, or FLIR,
which is fitted to the noses of many of the American fighters and attack
aircraft in the gulf region. The heart of the FLIR is a special camera
with a sensor chilled to minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit. The very low
temperature of this device enables it to detect the faint infrared
radiation given off by warmer objects, including tanks and warm human
beings. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-browne1991" role="doc-biblioref">Browne 1991</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit is approximately minus 195 degrees
Celsius - much colder than freezing. “Ice made it cold” may also allude
to the emotional detachment implied in the planning and execution of
military operations.</p>

</h3>
<p>The Gulf war was televised more than any war had been up to that
time, due to the use of satellite communications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We swamped the region with as many people and pieces of high
technology we could afford and get permission for. It produced
on-the-day war reporting on a scale never seen before. People will argue
about which was the first ‘television war’. Vietnam? The Israeli
invasion of Lebanon? The Falklands? I have no doubt that the Gulf was
the first war in which the full potential of satellite technology was
used, bringing with it new technical and ethical challenges for
broadcasters” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-purvis1991" role="doc-biblioref">Purvis 1991</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Video was used a part of the targeting systems for laser-guided
missiles and this footage was re-used in press briefings.</p>
<p>“Reach out and touch someone” was a well-known TV commercial for the
Bell and AT&amp;T telephone companies that was used from about 1979 to
1989 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-anand2021" role="doc-biblioref">Anand 2021</a>)</span>. Later, the phrase started
being used in a darker way to refer to long-distance acts of
terrorism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“‘During the Vietnam War,’ a top Bush adviser said about the menace
of terrorism, ‘people never thought there was the remotest chance that
the North Vietnamese could actually reach out and touch someone.’” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dowd1991" role="doc-biblioref">Dowd
1991</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, “reached out and touched them on a TV screen” sounds like
MacKaye is using the language that the Bush administration would use to
refer to terrorism to describe the actions of their own coalition in the
Gulf war.</p>

dirty machine.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#broke-out-the-polish-scrubbed-it-clean-scrubbed-it-clean-that-dirty-machine-"></a>
</h3>
<p>People use polish to make something shine - but it should be clean
first. The idea of polishing seems dissonant which comes next -
scrubbing clean a dirty machine. The polish is likely a visual metaphor
for the blackness that characterised a lot of the videos of bombing
raids that were used in press briefings by General Norman Schwarzkopf
and others <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sterlingrutherford1991a" role="doc-biblioref">Sterling
Rutherford 1991a</a>, <a href="#ref-sterlingrutherford1991b" role="doc-biblioref">1991b</a>)</span>. The videos were generally filmed
from the viewpoint of either the laser designator, in which case there
would be a plume of black smoke after impact, or the missile itself, in
which case the screen would briefly go black after impact.</p>
<p>“Scrubbed it clean” could be a metaphor for a missile destroying its
target. The repetition of the phrase could be for emphasis but could
also imply a double meaning, bringing to mind Lady Macbeth trying to get
the blood stain off her hands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out, damned spot; out, I say. One, two,—why, then ’tis time to do’t.
Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie, a soldier and afeard? What need we
fear who knows it when none can call our power to account? Yet who would
have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him? <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-shakespeare1606" role="doc-biblioref">Shakespeare 1606</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This wouldn’t be the first time or the last time this Shakespeare
reference appears in MacKaye’s songs, there is ‘Don’t you know ink
washes out / Easier than blood’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1990" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi 1990</a>)</span> and
also the clearest case ‘Soap and water will never get rid of that spot’
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-coriky2020" role="doc-biblioref">Coriky 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>“that dirty machine” suggests the machinery of war. The way in which
television journalists tend to present war has been the subject of
research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In ‘our’ war coverage, television journalists tend to excise the
opposite side, sanitize the suffering inflicted on it, attribute equal
strength to both sides, personalize ‘our’ side, demonize ‘their’ side,
and decontextualize its aggressive actions.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-liebes2009" role="doc-biblioref">Liebes 2009</a>)</span></p>

</h3>
<p>“This is your portion” compares TV news to food and hints at how
someone is deciding what gets served up to TV audiences, how much and in
what way.</p>
<p>The list here relates to thought and perception: “the only answer,
your only prayer, your reflection, please don’t stare”</p>
<p>“Please don’t share” suggests individuals are expected to receive
what they are being served in isolation.</p>
<p>The tone and the type of message here – a series of short statements
and requests – wrapped up in a catchy, repetitive chorus seems to allude
to the type of content used in TV advertising.</p>
<p>The omission of the ending to the phrase “Nothing is going on in…”
hints at how censorship and editing decisions may shape the perceptions
of people relying on the television to inform themselves about the
world.</p>

<p>Here the list seems to refer to behaviour and needs: “your manner,
what you wear, your diseases and your repairs, all your belongings”</p>
<p>“nothing is going on in” is repeated but this time the phrase is
finished – “nothing is going on in there”. The repeated use of
‘nothing’, as well as being related to the original song title and the
name of the album, recalls ‘She Watch Channel Zero’: ‘2, 7, 5, 4, 8, she
watched, she said / All added up to zero, and nothing in her head’,
which featured notable use of repetition to make a point – ‘she watch’ x
36 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-publicenemy1988" role="doc-biblioref">Public Enemy 1988</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>This seems to speak of technological change or political change
linked to sanitization. Again, the image of someone trying to clean
something that cannot be cleaned or is very difficult to clean. Package
versus contents contrasts the superficial appearance of things, how they
are presented, how they are sold, with what they really are on a deeper
more intrinsic level – which is not shared with the viewer and may not
be seen at all.</p>

</h3>
<p>“Came home flat busted only to be saved” suggests someone getting
home and slumping in front of the television, but that is not
necessarily the only meaning, it could also refer to someone using their
time and energy to do something else more worthwhile than watching
television.</p>
<p>“everything comes down to you in a world concave” sounds like a call
to action, to engage with the world and with other people – unlike the
TV screen which is convex (or it would have been at the time this song
was written), we are immersed in and surrounded by the real world.</p>
<p>This part of the song echoes TV Party: ‘We’ve got nothing better to
do / Than watch TV and have a couple of brews’ contrasted with ‘Hey,
wait a minute! My TV set doesn’t work (It’s broken!) / What are we gonna
do tonight, this isn’t fair! (We’re hurtin’!)’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-blackflag1981" role="doc-biblioref">Black Flag 1981</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The song ends with a criticism of passivity, “so well behaved”
echoing the starting line “got with the program”.</p>
<p>“We still turn on” sounds like a weary acknowledgement that despite
everything, it is hard to ignore the television coverage of the
unfolding war.</p>

</h2>
<p>It isn’t always clear who is doing what in this song. Who reaches out
and touches who? Who breaks out the polish? Who scrubs clean the dirty
machine? Who came home flat busted, and who saved them? Some of this
vagueness might be deliberate, echoing the nature of television war
coverage where it isn’t clear who is doing what, or what is really
happening.</p>
<p>“You” is clearer - “everything comes down to you in a world concave”
sounds like a direct appeal to the listener, perhaps echoing the
sentiment of The Revolution Will Not Be Televised <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-scott-heron1971" role="doc-biblioref">Scott-Heron 1971</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The use of “we” seems to indicate the community formed by band and
audience.</p>
<p>A recent discussion about this song on the podcast The Alphabetical
Fugazi focused on this being a song about television:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stakes are higher with Reclamation and it seems like a topic that
needs a plain-spoken, on-the nose statement, whereas maybe disliking
television programming is not one of those topics, and that’s the main
difference <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wright2021" role="doc-biblioref">Wright and Lalonde 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been many previous songs critical of the use of
television, for instance The Revolution will not be Televised <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-scott-heron1971" role="doc-biblioref">Scott-Heron 1971</a>)</span>, TV Party <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-blackflag1981" role="doc-biblioref">Black Flag 1981</a>)</span>, MTV-Get Off the Air
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-deadkennedys1985" role="doc-biblioref">Dead Kennedys 1985</a>)</span>, She Watch Channel
Zero?! <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-publicenemy1988" role="doc-biblioref">Public Enemy 1988</a>)</span> and (Welcome)
Television <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thebeatnigs1988" role="doc-biblioref">The Beatnigs 1988</a>)</span> – to name some likely
points of reference for the present song. What makes this song different
is the focus on how television was used in the context of the build-up
to the Gulf war and perhaps the early stages of the war itself. This
song is also notable in how it uses a range of different literary
devices: repetition, omission, euphemism, double meanings, allusions,
metaphors, slang and contextual references. Even the title, ‘Polish’, is
tricky as depending on capitalization and pronunciation it could mean
two completely different things, one of which seems to be a red herring.
The language used is not excessively cryptic but it isn’t very direct
either, compared to others such as ‘(Welcome) Television’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thebeatnigs1988" role="doc-biblioref">The Beatnigs 1988</a>)</span> which come right out
and say what they want to say without requiring much effort of
interpretation from the listener. The elusiveness of the lyrics brings
to mind the type of language used to evade censorship, which seems
appropriate to the context because during wartime the military censor
all communications to and from the war zone <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-omara1991" role="doc-biblioref">O’Mara 1991</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Considering the specific context helps to make sense of the strength
of feeling and urgency expressed by the song, and returning to the
Fugazi show in front of the White House on the 12th of January 1991 is a
good way to do this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The day before the event, a heavy snowstorm hit the city. The next
day, temperatures nudged into the 40s and the snow melted, but is was
cold and rainy. With the country preparing for war, police blanketed the
White House area. Despite the weather, around 3000 people showed up,
including rarely seen old allies like Squip. As the protesters beat on
oil barrels, drums, tin cans, and kettles, the organizers wondered what
to do about the show. Playing on an unprotected stage in the rain could
expose musicians and crew to potential electrocution. At one point the
rain stopped, only to begin again just as the band was ready to go.
Organizers and musicians huddled on the stage, trying to decide what to
do. Finally, feeling the gravity of the political moment, MacKaye said
simply, ‘Let’s fucking do it!’ All available hands scrambled to uncover
the gear and prepare for the chancy performance. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-andersen2009" role="doc-biblioref">Andersen and Jenkins 2009</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The willingness of the band to play in the rain on an outdoor stage
on a cold day, risking potential electrocution, clearly illustrates how
strongly they felt about all that was at stake. By way of an
introduction to KYEO Ian MacKaye spoke the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I gotta tell you I’m kinda terrified, it’s definitely looking like a
situation where you can’t turn around and worst of all it’s a decision
that none of us can even make, except for the fact that we didn’t say
anything in the first place about it, so because we didn’t, it’s time to
get even more louder and make more volume make more noise <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazil1991" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“FUGAZI Live in Front of THE WHITE HOUSE,
January 12, 1991 (Gulf War 1 Protest)”</span> 1991</a>; <a href="#ref-fugazi1991c" role="doc-biblioref">Fugazi
1991a</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ‘punk percussion protest’ started at the beginning of the war and
went on around the clock for several weeks at least.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the tocsin of war come the drums of war. “Those damned drums
are keeping me up all night,” the President told a gathering of
Republicans on Friday. The antiwar protesters camped in Lafayette Park
across the street from the White House have been beating a drum round
the clock since the war began, like an Edgar Allan Poe heartbeat
intended to pierce the President’s conscience as he sleeps in a room
above Pennsylvania Avenue <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dowd1991" role="doc-biblioref">Dowd 1991</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Bush tried and failed to get the drums silenced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the Gulf War, President George H.W. Bush was annoyed with an
anti-war demonstration in Lafayette Park. An ‘incessant’ drumbeat used
by protestors was so loud he ordered the drums silenced. ‘Those damn
drums are keeping me up all night,’ Mr. Bush told a group of visiting
congressmen. But a federal court held the park was a public place. The
whole point of free speech was to get the attention of the President.
The beat went on. - Roger McDaniel <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-yesterdaysamericaeditorialteam2020" role="doc-biblioref">Yesterday’s America Editorial Team
2020</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Polish seems to be strongly related to several other songs on the
Steady Diet of Nothing album, in particular Nice New Outfit and KYEO,
perhaps also Stacks. Keep Your Eyes Open (KYEO) emphasises the
importance of awareness complementing the concern about superficiality
in Polish, with specific reference to the military: “The troops are
quiet tonight, but it’s not alright, because we know they’re planning
something”. Stacks would probably also have been finished in January
1991, and several lines from this song could be interpreted as an
expression of profound discontent and disagreement with the
participation of the USA in the Gulf war: “I see them spinning on / So I
spin out / America is just a word but I use it.” The Coriky song ‘Clean
Kill’ revisited similar themes to those explored in ‘Nice New Outfit’
and ‘Polish’, almost thirty years later <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-coriky2020" role="doc-biblioref">Coriky 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusion"></a>
</h2>
<p>This song is about the use of television in a very specific context -
the participation of the US in the Gulf war (1990 - 1991). There is a
lot more depth and richness to the lyrics than first impressions might
suggest. The music sounds like a protest song, and the lyrics read as if
they had been written to get past military censorship.</p>

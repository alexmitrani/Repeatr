<p><a href="https://alexmitrani.shinyapps.io/Fugazetteer/" class="external-link">Fugazetteer</a>
makes it easy to get some insights and answer questions about the Fugazi
Live Series. It also provides several new ways of finding shows to
listen to.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-4B1DA5E2.png"></p>
<p>The app has 15 pages spread across 5 sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>today (1 page) - provides a summary of Fugazi shows on this day
in history.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-AA94891E.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flow (9 pages) - includes top-level menus for ‘year’ and ‘tour’
which will filter the contents of all the pages in this section.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-B24A6D35.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stock (4 pages) - includes a top-level menu for ‘release’ which
will filter the contents of all the pages in this section.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-50A7389F.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quiz (1 page) - links to Fugazi Live Series Quiz #1 and shows the
high scores to date.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-DC822963.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>index (1 page) - links to Fugazi Live Series Link Track Index and
shows the contents of the index.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-CC15C5E6.png"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the pages have a visualisation (map or graph) and a data
table further down the page, with the exception of ‘transition’,
‘duration’ and ‘search’ which only have data tables.</p>
<p>Most pages have a download button located to the right of the menu
controls, or at the bottom of the page if there are no menu controls,
which can be used to download the data table as a CSV file.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-9F81855C.png"></p>
<p>Most of the input boxes are ‘selectize’ controls - when you select
the control a menu will appear, and if you start typing the menu will be
filtered by what you type. You can select any number of items or none at
all.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/paste-ECE7F969.png" alt=""><p class="caption">‘Selectize’ control for tours on the ‘shows’
page.</p>
</div>
<p>A few of the input boxes are menus where you can only select one
option - these have a little down arrow to the right side of the input
box.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/paste-1F7CA3DC.png" alt=""><p class="caption">Selectize control for variable on the ‘releases’
page.</p>
</div>
<p>The data for songs is limited to songs that were played live at least
twice in the Fugazi Live Series. That is 92 songs which feature in the
Fugazi discography and two unreleased songs - ‘Preprovisional’ and
‘World Beat’.</p>
<p>The release dates are best estimates based on the available evidence.
Actual release dates will have varied depending on the location.</p>
<p>The show locations have been determined as closely as possible using
the available evidence. The search started with the information on the
Fugazi Live Series website, including any flyers and comments. Google
Maps would find some places quickly but others would be more difficult -
many of the venues are no longer there. The search was broadened using
sites like setlist.fm, which sometimes had addresses for old venues,
reading online publications, and reaching out to people who might
remember where the venues were located.</p>
<p><a href="http://subkultur-ost.de/Howl%2002-89%20%28Muenchen%29%20Fanzine%20%6089OCRkl.pdf" class="external-link"><img src="images/paste-784A0D87.png" alt="Ad with the address of the Bootleg, Augsburg, Germany, in Howl fanzine #2 (1989)."></a></p>

</div>
<p>There may still be “false positives” - cases where an address was
found but the address might be wrong. Please let me know if you find
anything that needs correcting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="today">today<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#today"></a>
</h2>
<p>This page provides a summary of Fugazi shows on a day in history.</p>
<p>By default your local date and time will be shown - today. If you
wish, you can edit the date in the input box to see the Fugazi shows on
another date.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-85995EA5.png"></p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="flow">flow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#flow"></a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>pulse stalls<br>

when you had thought it<br>
would force a flow</p>
<ul>
<li>last chance for a slow dance by Fugazi (1993)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This section focuses on the tours and live shows, and most of the
pages have a time dimension to them. The top-level menus of ‘year’ and
‘tour’ can be left blank but if applied will filter the contents of all
the pages in this section. This is useful if you are interested in a
specific year or tour. Note that you are not limited to just one year or
just one tour, in both cases several can be specified if you wish.</p>
<p>When a box is blank it means there is no filter applied to the data
for that variable. The selections apply sequentially from left to right
and from top to bottom. For instance, if you select a year the remaining
menus will be filtered to show only data for the selected year.</p>
<div class="figure">

selection functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="shows">shows<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#shows"></a>
</h3>
<p>The map shows the locations of the Fugazi shows and the table below
the map has some details of each show and a link to the corresponding
page on the <a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series" class="external-link">Fugazi
Live Series</a> site.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-1D915FB5.png"></p>
<p>The marker colours go from dark red to light red in chronological
order, with the most recent shows having the lightest colour.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-E1EA4F10.png"></p>
<p>The data can be filtered by typing in the selection boxes for
countries and cities.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-3C34068D.png"></p>
<p>The map has zoom controls and by clicking and dragging you can pan
the map view. The area of the red circle for each show is proportional
to the attendance of the show. If you click on the red circle for a show
a pop-up will appear with the date, the venue, the city, the attendance,
and the coordinates - in case you should want to look for a place using
a different mapping application.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-709B80CA.png"></p>
<p>The timeline slider below the map allows filtering the data by date.
The position of the slider control corresponds to the oldest date of the
selection, so if you move the slider forward from left to right you will
progressively filter out older shows.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-04B569C8.png"></p>
<p>There are some specific controls for use with the timeline
slider.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-8255316C.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the ‘map marker’ button will change the period to 1 week and the
step to 1 day, starting at the date selected with the timeline slider.
It will also change the start and end dates of the timeline slider to
match the start and end dates of the tour. You can then step forward
through the tour one day at a time, or use the ‘play’ button to the
bottom-right of the timeline to animate the tour.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-BFCB64BD.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘fast-forward’ will move the selection forward in time by one
step</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-121A7DF1.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘rewind’ will move the selection back in time by one step</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-56BF5277.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘home’ will move the timeline slider back to the beginning and
set the period to 792 weeks again, to select the entire series. It is
recommended to use the home button before changing the selections in the
selection boxes above the map.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-3FFF004B.png"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that pressing the ‘home’ button reveals additional
controls:</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-3CFB23A6.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><p>period_weeks indicates the duration of the selected period in
weeks. It is initially set to 792 weeks which covers the full duration
of the Fugazi Live Series.</p></li>
<li><p>step_days indicates the size of each step in days, this is for
use with the fast forward and reverse buttons.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These controls can be used to customise how the timeline works. For
instance, if you set ‘period_weeks’ to 52 and ‘step_days’ to 365, then
the map will show a year’s worth of shows from the date shown on the
timeline, and the forward and backward buttons will shift the period
shown forward or backward by 1 year. This can be useful if you want to
skip through the whole timeline quickly, one year at a time.</p>
<p>Unticking the ‘show’ checkbox will hide the ‘period_weeks’ and
‘step_days’ controls. This makes the interface less cluttered and will
be especially useful on mobile devices with small screens.</p>
<p>The data table below the map and the timeline controls shows summary
data for the selected shows.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-62A3D4E1.png"></p>
<p>Each of the following columns can be sorted using the sort controls
to the right of the variable name:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fls_link - a link to the corresponding page of the <a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series" class="external-link">Fugazi Live

<p><img src="images/paste-626A58E7.png"></p>
<p>The ‘graph’ menu offers three options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>releases - show how many songs were drawn from each release. This
option includes only songs.</p></li>
<li><p>unreleased - show how many songs were unreleased at the time.
This option includes only songs.</p></li>
<li><p>other - show how much of each show is songs and how much is other
stuff (intros, interludes, encores, one-offs and outros). This option
includes all the tracks of each show.</p></li>

<p>The remaining columns will vary depending on whether the option
selected for ‘variable’ is ‘releases’, ‘unreleased’, or ‘other’. All

<p>Here you can select specific songs and see information on how the
number of times they were played varied over time. For instance, here
the selected songs were all played a limited number of times, often over
a very limited period of time:</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-973341C3.png"></p>
<p>The graph shows the cumulative rendition counts for a selection of
songs that were played in the specified period. To avoid the graph
getting cluttered the songs are sorted in descending order of growth
rate over the period, and the song selection is limited to a maximum
number of songs. The maximum number of songs to be shown can be varied
using the slider control under the graph.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-204EC938.png"></p>
<p>The data can be filtered by the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>years</p></li>
<li><p>tours</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These filters are applied sequentially from left to right.</p>
<p>The graph shows a lot of detail on how each song fared across the
live series, including ‘flatline’ periods where songs were not played at
all, and periods of steep growth where songs were played night after
night for significant periods.</p>
<p>The data table shows summary information for each song over the
specified period.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-5D982D39.png"></p>
<p>The data table offers the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>release</p></li>
<li><p>song</p></li>
<li><p>from - first time performed (within the selected time
period)</p></li>
<li><p>to - last time performed (within the selected time
period)</p></li>
<li><p>released - corresponding release date</p></li>
<li><p>count - number of times performed (within the selected time
period)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dates and performance counts correspond to the selected data, so
these values will change whenever you change the filters for years or
tours.</p>
<p>The data table can be downloaded to a CSV file using the download
button at the top of the page to the right of the ‘songs’ selection
box.</p>

<p>The heatmap shows the number of times each transition was performed.
The graph is interactive - if you hover over a point, a pop-up will
appear showing ‘to’ (song), ‘from’ (song) and ‘count’ - the number of
times the transition was performed. The maximum number of transitions to
be shown can be varied using the slider control beneath the graph.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-1DAC5087.png"></p>
<p>The data table shows the number of times each transition featured in
the specified period. The transitions are shown in descending order of
plays.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/paste-6E1FFB77.png" alt=""><p class="caption">Data table on the ‘transitions’ page.</p>
</div>
<p>The data table includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>from - the first song in the transition</p></li>
<li><p>to - the second song in the transition</p></li>
<li><p>count - the number of times the transition was performed (within
the selected time period)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="transition">transition<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#transition"></a>
</h3>
<p>Here you can find shows that contain a specific transition between
songs.</p>
<p>There are two filters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>from - the first song in the transition</p></li>
<li><p>to - the second song in the transition</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The filters are applied sequentially from left to right, so for
instance if you specify ‘life and limb’ in ‘from’, the menu for ‘to’
will only show songs which followed ‘life and limb’.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-7A7D16CF.png"></p>
<p>Both filters are optional. If only one song is specified shows
containing that song will be listed. If no song is specified all the
shows will be listed. There is a subtle difference between searching for
shows containing a single song using the ‘from’ box and the ‘to’ box:
the ‘from’ box will omit shows where the song was the final one of the
set, and the ‘to’ box will omit shows where the song was the first one
of the set. This is why searching for ‘glueman’ with ‘from’ yields only
25 shows but searching for ‘glueman’ with ‘to’ yields 131 results -
‘glueman’ was a hard song to follow!</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-8936397B.png"></p>
<p>The data table includes:</p>

<li><p>fls_link provides a link to the corresponding page of the <a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series" class="external-link">Fugazi Live

<li><p>date - date of the show</p></li>
<li><p>transition - this is the number of the transition in the set,
where 1 is the first transition in that show. Larger numbers will
indicate that the transition was played later in the set.</p></li>

<p>Here you can compare two or more shows to find out which songs are
played in each, how many unique songs there are, and how many songs are
played only once or in 2 or more of the shows. You can pick shows from
the full series or you can filter first by year and/or tour to pick
shows from a shorter list. For example, we can compare the three Swedish
shows from the 2000 North European tour.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-71564DE5.png"></p>
<p>Note that the show identifiers are the same as those used on the
Fugazi Live Series website and have the following format:
city-country-(m)m-dd-yy. The month will be one or two digits depending
on which month it is.</p>
<p>Once shows have been selected, two results tables will appear. The
first is a summary table.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-8668F948.png"></p>
<p>The summary table tells us that 52 unique songs were played: 32 songs
were played only once, 12 songs were played twice, and 8 songs were
played at all 3 shows. The three shows have 80 songs in total, including
the repeated performances.</p>
<p>The Details table shows the complete list of songs, and for each song
which show or shows it was performed at. The table is sorted in
descending order of the number of shows each song was performed at, so
in this case the top part of the table lists the 8 songs that were
performed at all 3 shows.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-9AFEBC56.png"></p>

<p>Here you can choose any show (out of the 899 shows with set lists
available to date) and then a stack that contains the selected show. The
stacks are named after the initial show that was chosen when the stack
was created. Many shows appear in only one stack but some shows appear
in many stacks. Once you have chosen a show and a stack, you will get a
short sequence of 9-12 shows including the selected shows and covering
all 94 songs that Fugazi played live at least twice.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-29DAE6BE.png"></p>
<p>Once a stack has been selected, two results tables will appear. The
first is a summary table, including links to the shows.</p>

<p>The ‘variable’ menu has five options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>count - the number of times the song was performed in the Fugazi
Live Series. All else being equal, older songs tend to have higher
counts because they were available in the band’s repertoire for more
shows.</p></li>
<li><p>intensity - the number of times the song was performed divided by
the number of shows since the song’s debut. This variable normalizes the
counts by the potential maximum number of performances to give fairer
treatment to newer songs.</p></li>
<li><p>rating - the rating calculated for the song based on preferences
implied by the choices of which songs to play.</p></li>
<li><p>tempo_bpm - tempo in Beats Per Minute.</p></li>
<li><p>minutes - duration in minutes</p></li>

<p>If no release filter has been applied, the data table will show
summary information for each release.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-7A5A3649.png"></p>
<p>The data table includes the following columns, all of which can be
sorted:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>release</p></li>
<li><p>first_debut - the date of the first debut from this
release</p></li>
<li><p>last_debut - the date of the last debut from this
release</p></li>
<li><p>release_date - this is an assumption based on the available
evidence. Actual release dates will have been different in different
places.</p></li>
<li><p>songs - number of songs on the release</p></li>
<li><p>count - total number of performances of the songs on the
release</p></li>
<li><p>shows - number of shows at which songs from the release were
performed</p></li>
<li><p>intensity - the average of the intensities of the songs on the
release</p></li>
<li><p>rating - the average of the ratings o f the songs on the
release</p></li>
<li><p>tempo_bpm - the weighted average tempo of the release in Beats
Per Minute (weighted by the duration of each song)</p></li>
<li><p>minutes - the total duration in minutes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The counts, intensities and ratings give different results if they
are used to rank the releases. Repeater was the album that yielded more
live performances than any other in Fugazi’s catalogue, but The Argument
had the highest performance rate in relation to the number of shows at
which these songs were available. The top 3 places are the same in terms
of rating and intensity, but further down the table there are
differences - the Fugazi EP is ranked higher than Red Medicine and In on
the Killtaker when the releases are ranked by rating. This is probably
because the ratings take into account the age of the releases and
separate the effects of age from the implied preferences.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>renditions - the number of times the song was played</p></li>
<li><p>minutes_min - the minimum duration. In many cases this will be as
short as it is because the recording was cut off, not because the band
played the song really fast.</p></li>
<li><p>minutes_median - the median duration: if all the renditions were
lined up in order from shortest to longest this would be the middle
one.</p></li>
<li><p>minutes_max - the maximum duration.</p></li>
<li><p>minutes_mean - the average duration.</p></li>

rendition (in minutes). You can also select more than one song. The
table headers can be used to sort the data, so for instance you can find
the shows with the longest (or shortest) renditions of a particular

<h2 id="index">index<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#index"></a>
</h2>
<p>Fugazi used to play “link tracks” in practices, sound checks, and
sometimes as introductions or interludes at shows. Some of them feature
in the live series but they are hard to find because they often have
generic names like “intro”, “interlude”, “encore”, or “link track”. I
noticed there are a few of these that get played repeatedly, sometimes
over a period of years, so I started giving them index numbers to make
it easier to find and compare these pieces of music. So far I have found
3 different link tracks that got played live at least twice - see the
image. I’ve given them the same index number if they seem to be the same
piece of music. The idea is to add new numbers to the link track index
for other link tracks that are different from the ones that have been
found so far. Please add to the link track index if you come across any
other ones - using the ‘Link Track Index’ link will take you to a form
where you can enter information. Any link track information you add
using the form will be included in the link track index shown on this
page of the Fugazetteer site.</p>

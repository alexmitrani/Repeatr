R code for analysis of Fugazi Live Series metadata: https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series

The initial data was provided by Ian James Wright of the Alphabetical Fugazi podcast and was probably extracted from the Fugazi Live Series website with fugotcha: https://github.com/universalhandle/fugotcha

At present the code generates performance counts of all released Fugazi songs, in descending order, based on data from 1048 shows up to and including FLS1045. 

The frequency counts do not necessarily measure the band's preferences for the songs, as more recently released songs were available for fewer shows than older songs.  

It should be possible to do a more in-depth analysis of this data to work out implied ratings for the songs taking into account the evolution over time of the band's repertoire. If and when this sort of analysis is undertaken it will be added here together with the results.   

Thanks.

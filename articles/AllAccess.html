<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>On Sunday the 24 of October 2021 I spoke with Ian James Wright for
the ‘Steady Diet’ episode of the Alphabetical Fugazi podcast, and Ian
kindly shared with me his Fugazi Live Series data. I found the Fugazi
Live Series data fascinating and I already knew I liked the music as I
had been a Fugazi fan for over 30 years, so before long I had bought
myself an ‘All Access’ subscription.</p>
<p>Between the 15 of November 2021 and the 4 of February 2024 I listened
to all the shows that were available on the Fugazi Live Series site and
whatever additional shows I could find. I listened to 915 Fugazi shows
in 812 days - I tried to limit myself to 1 show a day but there were a
few days when I listened to more than one. I went through the series in
chronological order from FLS0001 (1987-09-03) to FLS1045 (2002-11-04)
and then did a search for <a href="https://alexmitrani.github.io/Repeatr/articles/Outsiders.html">additional
shows not yet available on the Fugazi Live Series site</a> and listened
to those as well. The show I ended on was FLS0177 (1990-01-27),
St. Augustine’s Church Hall, the first show of 1990 and a fitting
conclusion to what had been an interesting and enjoyable journey.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="listening">Listening<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#listening"></a>
</h2>
<p>Fugazi used to play without a pre-determined set list, they would
agree on the first song, then Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto would take
turns singing (with Joe Lally singing some songs as well from 1993
onwards), but other than that no-one knew exactly what song would come
next until they started playing it <span class="citation">(Friedman and
Picciotto 2019)</span>. This randomness and spontaneity resulted in each
show being unique - they never played exactly the same set twice (yes, I
checked), and also Fugazi would often play the same songs differently,
in particular Suggestion, Glue Man, Promises, Reprovisional and Shut the
Door would often include extended improvisations which would mean even
the same song would be different from one show to the next.</p>
<p>One of the things I really enjoyed about the All Access pass and
listening to the shows in chronological order was that it freed me from
picking shows. I would just listen to the next one in the series and I
would make a point of not checking the tracklist or the comments on the
Fugazi Live Series site before listening to the show. This way the
listening experience would be as close as it could be to the experience
of attending a live show, where you would never know what was coming
next. I would often close my eyes, pogo a bit, dance around and wave my
arms - this would get the blood pumping and make it more enjoyable. This
is not music for sitting down. I recommend trying to have a few
expectations as possible - let the band surprise you. Fugazi would start
playing new songs as soon as they were ready so the band’s repertoire
was always evolving, and it was always a particularly nice surprise to
hear a song played for what would have been the first time.</p>
<p>After listening to the show I would check the Fugazi Live Series
page, read other people’s comments and add a few of my own if it seemed
that there was something else to be said. If I really liked the show and
felt I would want to listen to it again in future I would add it to my
<a href="https://alexmitrani.github.io/Repeatr/articles/Playlist.html">playlist</a>.
If I wrote something that seemed worth sharing I would share my notes on
the <a href="https://web.facebook.com/groups/Fugazi.appreciation.group/" class="external-link">Facebook
group</a> - one of the limitations of the Fugazi Live Series site is
that if you reply to someone else’s comments they won’t automatically
get a notification. That said, the site is actively moderated and I
found that the moderator would occasionally send an e-mail if they saw
that someone was replying to something someone else had written.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="ratings">Ratings<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ratings"></a>
</h2>
<p>My first use of the data was to estimate implied song ratings based
on the band’s choices of which songs to perform. This was the beginning
of what would become the <a href="https://alexmitrani.shinyapps.io/Fugazetteer/" class="external-link">Fugazetteer</a> web
app. It was also one of my first experiences of Fugazi’s tendency to
defy expectations. One of my assumptions was that the band would play
each song only once on any given night. I soon heard back that there
were several exceptions to this, and found that <a href="https://alexmitrani.github.io/Repeatr/articles/LinkTracks.html#three-repeats-but-only-one-two-for-tuesdays">Fugazi
played a song twice on at least three occasions</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="map">Map<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#map"></a>
</h2>
<p>I got into the habit of listening to a show in the morning while I
was getting up and doing exercises, this way I could fit in one show a
day without it affecting my other activities too much. Listening to the
shows in chronological order produced a pleasant feeling of travelling,
and I enjoyed imagining and finding out about the different places the
tours would take the band, as well as the different bands that would
accompany Fugazi.</p>
<p>My curiosity kept leading me to other ways of using the Fugazi Live
Series data, some of which involved adding new variables to the data. I
added the coordinates of the venues because I wanted a map that would
help me to visualize where each show was and where the band was going to
next. Locating the venues was easier said than done in some cases as
many venues no longer exist so I had to look through flyers, old
fanzines, and ask people who had been to the shows. People I reached out
to on social media or by e-mail almost invariably replied and were
friendly and helpful. This small project of locating the venues of the
Fugazi Live Series is probably the closest I ever got to doing
historical research.</p>
<p><a href="http://subkultur-ost.de/Howl%2002-89%20%28Muenchen%29%20Fanzine%20%6089OCRkl.pdf" class="external-link"><img src="images%2Fpaste-784A0D87-01.png" alt="Ad for the Bootleg Augsburg venue in Howl 02-89 (Muenchen) Fanzine"></a></p>
<p>Locating the venues took time but I got quite a lot of use out of the
resulting maps, because Fugazi would go to far-flung places and would
make tours that would not fit neatly on maps. For instance, they played
Tromso in Norway in 1990 (350 km north of the Arctic Circle); Anchorage,
Alaska in 1995; Darwin, Australia in 1997; and when they went to Brazil
they did a proper tour visiting some smaller places as well as several
of the big cities. I found that being able to follow each tour on a map
made listening to the Fugazi Live Series more interesting and enjoyable.
Sometimes the maps would also help understand the band’s on-stage
banter, which would sometimes refer to the drive they just made to get
to the show, the ferry that they had missed, or the trip they had made
in their time off.</p>

</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="playlists">Playlists<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#playlists"></a>
</h2>
<p>As I made my way through the series I took note of the shows I would
probably want to come back to and listen to again in future. The result
was a playlist of 246 shows which can be found <a href="https://alexmitrani.github.io/Repeatr/articles/Playlist.html">here</a>.
This is not an exhaustive list of good shows, these are just the shows
that stood out to me. I was trying to be selective so if there was a run
of shows that all sounded good I would try to just pick a few and not
all of them. The sound quality and the availability of recordings both
tend to improve as the series progresses, so there are relatively fewer
shows from the early part of the series, for most of the middle part of
the series I was picking approximately 1 in 5 shows, and towards the end
of the series I was picking more because most of the shows sounded
really good. Overall 246 from 915 is about 27% - a bit more than 1 in
4.</p>
<p>Some of the shows on the playlist are not there because they sound
great, some of them are there because they are interesting or unusual
for other reasons. For instance there is <a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/dallas-tx-usa-50490" class="external-link">FLS0203,
2301 Canton Warehouse, Dallas, TX, USA, 1990-05-04</a> where a fire
warden wanted to shut down the show and the band ended up playing to an
empty warehouse with the audience outside in the street. Ian MacKaye
tells the story much better than me <span class="citation">(Mackaye
2013)</span>. <a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/phoenix-az-usa-90991" class="external-link">FLS0396,
Silver Dollar, Phoenix, AZ, USA, 1991-09-09</a> was so eventful it seems
almost cinematic. Another one that comes to mind is <a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/peoria-il-usa-100995" class="external-link">FLS0731,
Expo Gardens, Peoria, IL, USA, 1995-10-09</a> where the band comes up
with a creative solution to deal with a few anti-social but extremely
persistent crowd surfers. Then there is <a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/san-antonio-tx-usa-111895" class="external-link">FLS0761,
Showcase Special Events, San Antonio, TX, USA, 1995-11-18</a> which
probably holds the record for the highest number of expulsions.</p>
<p>Later on I made another, much shorter list which I call the
‘miniseries’ - 9 shows that include at least one rendition of all 94
songs that were played at least twice in the Fugazi Live Series,
including all the rare ones:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/linz-austria-111088" class="external-link">FLS0073,
Kapu, Linz, Austria 1988-10-11</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/new-york-ny-usa-100989" class="external-link">FLS0149,
Barnard College Cafeteria, New York, NY, USA, 1989-10-09</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/washington-dc-usa-41291" class="external-link">FLS0327,
Sacred Heart Church Hall, Washington, DC, USA, 1991-04-12</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/athens-ga-usa-21993" class="external-link">FLS0505,
40 Watt, Athens, GA, USA, 1993-02-19</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/leeds-england-51595" class="external-link">FLS0664,
Metropolitan University, Leeds, England, 1995-05-15</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/washington-dc-usa-13096" class="external-link">FLS0764,
Black Cat, Washington, DC, USA, 1996-01-30</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/hoboken-nj-usa-72798" class="external-link">FLS0870,
Maxwell’s, Hoboken, NJ, USA, 1998-07-27</a></p>
<p><a href="https://dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/washington-dc-usa-42701" class="external-link">FLS0998,
Sacred Heart Church, Washington, DC, USA, 2001-04-27</a></p>
<p><a href="https://dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/leeds-england-103102" class="external-link">FLS1041,
Metropolitan University, Leeds, UK, 2002-10-31</a></p>
<p>Nearly all (8 of the 9) shows on the short list are on the long list
as well, so I feel confident in recommending the miniseries to those who
might want a short, reasonably representative sample of the Fugazi Live
Series.</p>

<h2 id="fugazetteer">Fugazetteer<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fugazetteer"></a>
</h2>
<p>Fugazetteer is a web app based on the Fugazi Live Series data, it
aims to make it easier to answer questions about the series and to find
interesting shows to listen to. If you enjoy listening to shows from the
Fugazi Live Series you might find it interesting and useful. It includes
maps, graphs, information on the durations of shows and renditions, and
a variety of different ways of searching for shows. Where appropriate,
Fugazetteer provides links back to the corresponding show pages on the
Fugazi Live Series site. You can find the Fugazetteer app <a href="https://alexmitrani.shinyapps.io/Fugazetteer/" class="external-link">here</a> and the
documentation <a href="https://alexmitrani.github.io/Repeatr/articles/Fugazetteer.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="quiz">Quiz<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quiz"></a>
</h2>
<p>I wrote a quiz about the Fugazi Live Series as a way of making use of
the considerable amount of trivia knowledge I accumulated while making
my way through the live series. There are 76 questions worth a total of
162 points. You can find it <a href="https://forms.gle/cxWd38nPi6Dtk9ub8" class="external-link">here</a>. It’s a proper hard
quiz, it’ll be a good challenge for you. There is a high scores table
included in the Fugazetteer app, and you’ll be included in the high
scores table if your score places you in the top half.</p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#practicalities"></a>
</h2>
<p>An All Access pass allows you to download all the shows from the
Fugazi Live Series website via a ‘Fugazi Live Series’ button that
appears at the top of your ‘My Account’ page. You need to download the
shows one by one. I used to download shows about once a week, at the
weekend I’d download the shows for the next week or so.</p>
<p>I ended up spending a few minutes editing the metadata and filenames
of each show to make sure that each MP3 file had a unique filename and
it would be easy to find any show based on the date. I renamed each
album starting with the date in format YYYYMMDD and each file with the
date and the 2-digit track number (with leading zero if necessary) so
the files end up named like YYYYMMDDTT and can be sorted in
chronological order. This makes shows easy to find by just typing in the
date of the show, and specific renditions of songs can be found by
typing in the date and track number.</p>
<p>The Fugazi Live Series takes up about 160 GB of disk space - that is
including embedded images for album art. It fits on a pendrive. I wanted
to be able to listen to any show in the series from my phone via Wi-Fi
and the way I found to do this was to buy cloud storage and to use a
mobile app that allows playing or downloading music from cloud storage.
At the time of writing there are some providers offering lifetime deals
on cloud storage, I got one of those because that way the cost of the
cloud storage seemed proportional and is never going to be more than the
price I paid for the Fugazi Live Series All Access pass.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusion"></a>
</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed listening to the Fugazi Live Series, it includes a
lot of great music, lively banter, and was in general an interesting
experience. I learned a lot in the process, for instance I learned to
appreciate live music and live music recordings a lot more than I did
before. I took notes of the shows that stood out to me as I went through
the series and ended up with <a href="https://alexmitrani.github.io/Repeatr/articles/Playlist.html">a
list of 246 shows</a>, which was me trying to be selective. An All
Access Pass is definitely worth considering if you can afford it and
like Fugazi’s music.</p>
<p>There’s an anecdote about painting the Forth Bridge (near Edinburgh,
Scotland) which is that by the time they finished painting the bridge
they would have to start painting it again at the other end. An All
Access pass to the Fugazi Live Series is a lifetime supply of Fugazi
live recordings because even if you listen to all of them, by the time
you reach the end you will have forgotten the ones at the beginning. So
I could just start at the beginning again, but not now. I need to take a
break.</p>

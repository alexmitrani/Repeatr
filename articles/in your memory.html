</h2>
<p>Forensic Scene was played live for the first time at Colégio Leão
XIII in Itaboraí, RJ, Brazil on 19 August 1994 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1994">Fugazi 1994</a>)</span>,
introduced by Guy with the comment “you’re probably going to hate this
song but we’re going to play it anyway”. Forensic Scene was one of 6
songs from the forthcoming Red Medicine album to be launched on that
1994 tour of Brazil - including the full version of ‘By You’ (with
vocals) - first played on 15 August 1994 in Belo Horizonte - which had
been played 5 times in 1993 as an instrumental. ‘Fell, Destroyed’ was
played as an instrumental at least 10 times starting in August 1993
before finally being performed with vocals on 2 March 1995, after it was
recorded and not long before the release of Red Medicine.</p>

<p>The song got it’s official release on Red Medicine which was released
around the 12 May 1995 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1995">Fugazi 1995a</a>)</span>. Fugazi played Forensic
Scene at least 201 times with the last recorded version being on the 4
November 2002 in London, England - the final Fugazi show to date. It was
the 5th most played song from Red Medicine. In live shows Forensic Scene
tended to be used later in the set, it was often followed by Promises
(31 times) or by Long Division (21 times).</p>
<p>There are several interviews where Guy Picciotto has commented on the
song. In 1995 he only commented in outline:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t normally discuss what songs are actually specifically about.
I feel like that the work that was put into creating the song is the
expression and that people who listen to the song, if they’re interested
in the song, create their own interpretations. I feel like, if it
doesn’t make any sense, then I didn’t succeed when I wrote the song. I’m
willing to accept that as a failure, but in general… Sometimes I’ll
discuss a song like Cassavetes on In on the Kill Taker. I can say that
that’s a song about the filmmaker John Cassavetes, because it seems to
be fairly obvious, but Forensic scene… It’s like a less… It’s a more
personal song. You can’t say that it’s about a specific person or
something like that. It’s more about a situation. And I think it’s up to
people to figure it out for themselves. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mackaye1995">MacKaye and Picciotto 1995</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a 2025 interview with Brian Gathy for the End on End podcast he
went into more detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brendan actually wrote the verse chords and I wrote the chorus
chords… the verse chords seem simple but it’s actually a very
complicated thing. Brendan writes some very complicated guitar shit. His
chordings are so wild and it’s one of my favourite things that he ever
wrote. The pleasure of learning to play that and then figuring out how
to sing to it and then coming up with some big chorus … it’s one of my
favourite things that Brendan and I worked on together, and it really
came from those initial chordings that Brendan came up with, that are so
interesting.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-picciotto2025">Picciotto 2025</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a very sad moment that produced that song, I don’t really have
anything more specific to say to it than that, … it was kind of like
that forensic analysis post-fact of the horrible thing that had just
happened” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-picciotto2025">Picciotto
2025</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first time the song was recorded live, in August 1994, it was
fully formed with both lyrics and music being more or less identical to
the studio version that would be recorded in early 1995. This strongly
suggests it had been written, rehearsed and possibly performed live some
time earlier. The 1993 Japan / Australia / New Zealand Tour ended in
Honolulu, Hawaii on the 14 December 1993 and the next show after that
was Brendan’s Going Away Party at Pirate House on 3 June 1994 (no
recording exists). After that Brendan went to live in Seattle for
several months, which means Forensic Scene was probably written sometime
between December 1993 and May 1994.</p>

</h2>
<p>The American Academy of Forensic Sciences has this to say about the
word ‘forensic’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word forensic comes from the Latin word forensis: public, to the
forum or public discussion; argumentative, rhetorical, belonging to
debate or discussion. A relevant, modern definition of forensic is:
relating to, used in, or suitable to a court of law. Any science used
for the purposes of the law is a forensic science. … Forensic scientists
may be involved anytime an objective, scientific analysis is needed to
find the truth and to seek justice in a legal proceeding. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-aafs2022">AAFS 2022</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Scene’ has several possible meanings <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-merriam-webster2025">Merriam-Webster 2025a</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>one of the subdivisions of a play</p></li>
<li><p>a stage setting, or a real / imaginary view suggesting a stage
setting</p></li>
<li><p>the place of an occurrence or action</p></li>
<li><p>an exhibition of anger or indecorous behavior</p></li>
<li><p>a sphere of activity or situation</p></li>

<p>The lyrics from the studio recording will be referred to here <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1995">Fugazi 1995a</a>)</span> -
there are some variations in live recordings. The lyric sheet uses all
lower case with no line breaks, here I’m going to use lower case and
line breaks based on how it is sung.</p>
<p>Notice how many of the lines are couplets and some of them rhyme
although the rhymes seem forced at times: gentle / sentimental; without
/ now; would / wound; lay / anyway; unclean / scene; instant /
distance.</p>

<p>There is a song called ‘Caught without an umbrella’ by Spearhead
(Michael Franti’s band) from 1994 that is about a failed suicide attempt

<p>This is on me, it’s not your responsibility anymore. Taking
responsibility for a bad situation or for having done something wrong.
Expresses humility and perhaps also regret.</p>
<p>‘Not your failure now’ hints at a family or intergenerational aspect
to the situation, for instance a person with a troubled childhood whose
parents might have felt that they failed in giving them a good
upbringing. It also suggests finality, the end of a relationship.</p>

</h3>
<p>Unusual usage of tax. The only similar usage I could find was in an
academic paper on the etymology of the word ‘dismal’, which suggests a
possible connection to some religious practices such as fasting and
flagellation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in our sentence, desmar las carns, the verb desmar is used to refer,
not to time, but to the flesh… ‘to decimate, to diminish’. “now is the
time to ‘tax’ the flesh.” The phrase decimare carnem is but a variant of
the phrase exuere carnem which, according to Saint Augustine, expresses
the duty of the christian who wants to follow Christ. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-spitzer1942">Spitzer
1942</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Cheap wound’ implies that it is something small, not a serious
injury, which seems consistent with the idea of a needle being used for
injections.</p>

<p>This brings to mind press coverage of celebrities, in particular
their misfortunes and relationships. For instance, from the 1992 Vanity
Fair article ‘Strange Love’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are Courtney Love, lead diva of the postpunk band Hole, and her
husband, Nirvana heartthrob Kurt Cobain, the grunge John and Yoko? Or
the next Sid and Nancy? <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hirschberg1992">Hirschberg 1992</a>)</span></p>

<p>Forensic seems to be used here in the sense of people trying to
figure out what happened, why it happened, and who is to blame.</p>
<p>Most if not all of the meanings of ‘scene’ seem relevant here. Scene
as in a place where something happened, a community of bands and
musicians, and an actual or imagined visual perspective.</p>

<p>‘no shit sherlock’, meaning something that is obvious and does not

<p>Forensic Scene is probably one of the saddest Fugazi songs if not the
saddest, although it transmits other emotions as well, in particular
anger and frustration. At about 80 beats per minute, it is one of the
slowest songs in the Fugazi repertoire, although there are several
changes to pace and volume which make it interesting. The song is
structured verse 1 - chorus - verse 2 - instrumental break - chorus. It
starts abruptly, is sung softly softly up to about the middle, gets a
bit faster and more energetic in the instrumental break, and then gets
louder and heavier towards the end, which is often stretched out a bit.
There is crescendo effect over the length of the song before it grinds
to a halt.</p>

</h2>
<p>The tempo varies quite a bit across different renditions, for
instance the 1996 show at the 40 Watt in Athens, GA seems particularly
slow, and on top of that Guy seems to sing something completely
different for the most of the second verse <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1996b">Fugazi 1996b</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The 1995 show at Queen’s Hall, Belfast contains a grungy extended
ending with Ian and Guy singing “over and over and over and over and
over and over and over and over and over and over…” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1995a">Fugazi
1995b</a>)</span></p>
<p>Many live performances of Forensic Scene include an additional line
just before the instrumental break, some of these are easier to make out
than others, for instance “take a walk, sister” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1996">Fugazi 1996a</a>)</span>,
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1996a">Fugazi

<p>At least twice Guy omitted the ‘con’ from ‘congenital’, singing
“fucked and fucking, love and lay, genitally fractured anyway” - for
instance at TU Mensa, Berlin in 1995 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1995b">Fugazi 1995c</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>What happened between December 1993 and May 1994 that could be
described as a ‘horrible thing’ and might have prompted the composition
of this song? One event in particular comes to mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NIRVANA SINGER FOUND DEAD By Richard Harrington and Richard Lei.
April 9, 1994. Kurt Cobain, who led the grunge band Nirvana to
superstardom yet reviled his own success, was found shot in the head in
his Seattle home yesterday, an apparent suicide. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-harrington1994">Harrington and Leiby

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Love reconstructed the rest of the tragedy for MTV: Cobain drew a
chair up to a window overlooking the Puget Sound, sat down, took some

<p>The rest of the press cuttings in this section have been chosen

<blockquote>
<p>With his untimely death, Cobain enters a sad rock pantheon that
includes Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin, along with Seattle musicians
Jimi Hendrix, Stephanie Sargent of the band 7 Year Bitch, and Anthony
Wood of Mother Love Bone. “Now he’s gone and joined that stupid club,”
Cobain’s mother, Wendy O’Connor, told reporters yesterday. “I told him
not to join that stupid club.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-harrington1994">Harrington and Leiby 1994</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All three members of Nirvana came from broken homes. Cobain, son of
an auto mechanic and secretary who divorced when he was 8, did not speak
to his father for eight years – until signing his breakthrough contract
with Geffen in 1990. As a shy teenager, he became enthralled with punk
rock and began collecting records and playing guitar, though he saw
himself as a rhythm guitarist – out of the limelight. When Cobain was
still a teenager, his father had forced him to pawn his guitar and join
the Navy; instead Cobain reclaimed the guitar and left home. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-harrington1994">Harrington and Leiby

<blockquote>
<p>On behalf of Dave, Pat, and I, I would like to thank you all for your
concern at this time. We remember Kurt for what he was: caring,
generous, and sweet. Let’s keep the music with us. We’ll always have it…
Forever. Kurt had an ethic towards his fans that was rooted in the punk
rock way of thinking. No band is special, no player royalty. But if
you’ve got a guitar and a lot of soul just bang something out and mean
it. You’re the superstar. Plugged in the tones and rhythms that are
uniquely and universally human: music. Heck… use your guitar as a drum,
just catch the groove and let it flow out of your heart. That’s the
level Kurt spoke to us on: in our hearts, and that’s where he, and the
music, will always be, forever. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-novoselic1994">Novoselic 1994</a>)</span></p>

<p>The following extracts are from Courtney Love’s pre-recorded eulogy
which was played at a public memorial service on 10 April 1994 at the
Seattle Center. In the recording she intersperses parts of Kurt Cobain’s
suicide note with her own comments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This note should be pretty easy to understand. All the warnings
from the punk rock 101 courses over the years since my first
introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and
embracement of your community, has proven to be very true. I haven’t
felt the excitement of listening to, as well as creating music, along
with really writing something, for too many years now. I feel guilty
beyond words about these things - for example, when we’re backstage and
the lights go out and the roar of the crowd begins, it doesn’t affect me
the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love and
relish the love and adoration of the crowd.</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cobain1994">Cobain 1994</a>)</span></p>
<p>Well, Kurt, so fucking what - then don’t be a rock star you asshole.
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-love1994">Love
1994</a>)</span></p>
<p><em>Which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact, I can’t
fool you, any one of you, it simply isn’t fair to you or to me. The
worst crime I could think of would be to put people off by faking it,
pretending as if I’m having 100% fun.</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cobain1994">Cobain 1994</a>)</span></p>
<p>No Kurt, the worst crime I can think of is for you to just continue
being a rock star when you fucking hate it, just fucking stop. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-love1994">Love 1994</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I’m laying in our bed, and I’m really sorry. And I feel the same
way you do. I’m really sorry you guys. I don’t know what I could have
done. I wish I’d been here. I wish I hadn’t listened to other people,
but I did. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-love1994">Love

</blockquote>
<p>On the aftermath, including comments from counselors and help-line
workers concerned about young people at risk of suicide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The days after Cobain’s death were filled with grief, confusion and
finger pointing for all concerned. “Everyone who feels guilty, raise
your hand,” Love told MTV the morning after Cobain was found. She said
she was wearing Cobain’s jeans and socks and carrying a lock of her
husband’s blond hair. According to Billig, a doctor was summoned to stay
with Love at all times. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-strauss1994">Strauss 1994</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Cobain’s suicide does send a message, certainly, particularly for
youth on the edge. These musicians are kids’ role models. They find
their identity in the music. It’s an angry-tone music, angst filled,
hopeless to a certain degree. But Nirvana’s not suggesting everybody go
out and shoot themselves. The main thing is to focus on what’s causing
suicidal feelings, what the issues are. Suicide is a permanent solution
to a temporary problem. The intensity is real subjective, the feeling
that it will never change. But this is what not to do. If you’re feeling
overwhelmed, use the phone as a tool. Reach out and get help.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-anders1994">Anders 1994</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“When we see this popular person, we tend to think that they have
everything. And yet something about that still doesn’t make their life
okay – so the message is that nothing makes you happy enough to make you
want to live. Young people may think, ‘He did it. That means that I
could also do it.’ This reminds me of when Magic Johnson announced he
was HIV-positive: It creates more intensity of vulnerability. Like, ‘My
God, it can also happen to me.’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-anders1994">Anders 1994</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think there’s a lot of anger in a suicide, generally. And I always
think that the anger is turned against the self. For kids who are so
turned on by him, maybe it would help them to know that they are not the
object of his anger – probably his wife or his mother or father
are.”</p>
<p>Gene Gordon, professor of psychiatry, George Washington University
Medical School <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-anders1994">Anders

</blockquote>
<p>The following extracts are about works of music or art that were
produced later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been 2 years, 2 months and 15 days since Cobain, the leader of
Nirvana, was found dead in a small room above his garage, and songs
influenced by his suicide continue to stream out of songwriters’ pens
from Seattle to Dublin. There are scores of songs known to be about Kurt
Cobain – among them ones by Neil Young, Pearl Jam, the Cranberries,
R.E.M., Julian Cope, Vernon Reid and the Tragically Hip – and dozens
more believed to be about Cobain, though the bands aren’t telling (the
Foo Fighters, Filter). <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-strauss1996">Strauss 1996</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a painting made in 2004 called ‘Untitled (forensic scene)’
by Jordan Kantor <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kantor2004">Kantor 2004</a>)</span>, an artist whose
“painting practice is fueled by breakdowns or gaps in perception, often
caused by the intermediary presence of the camera”. The painting is part
of a series where “he has relied on the spotty photographic record of
the scene of Kurt Cobain’s suicide to piece together impressions of the
place and event, drawn by the intense public interest in it as well as
the compelling privacy and lack of access that discouraged further
knowledge.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Untitled (forensic scene)</em> (2004), is a painting of a
zoomed-in view of what you might see if the policeman were to move
aside. It’s the only painting in the cluster, and, on the one hand, a
fragmentary recasting of Manet’s <em>The Dead Toreador</em>, on the
other hand, a commentary on how the artist sees his subject. I like to
think the kneeling figure is Kantor himself, winking off camera at the
viewer: <em>This is what we do</em>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rader2017">Rader 2017</a>)</span></p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#discussion"></a>
</h2>
<p>Guy’s comment that “it’s a more personal song” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mackaye1995">MacKaye and Picciotto
1995</a>)</span> is helpful for understanding the lyrics. With this in
mind I understand “in your memory” as about the memory of someone, not
about somebody else remembering something. Furthermore, “from your
memory to this instant” suggests that the person being remembered might
be dead.</p>
<p>Guy noted that “You can’t say that it’s about a specific person or
something like that. It’s more about a situation.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mackaye1995">MacKaye and Picciotto
1995</a>)</span>. However, considering the time interval in which
Forensic Scene would have been written, and Guy’s comment that “it was a
very sad moment that produced that song … it was kind of like that
forensic analysis post-fact of the horrible thing that had just
happened” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-picciotto2025">Picciotto
2025</a>)</span>, it seems likely that the lyrics to Forensic Scene were
written about the aftermath of Kurt Cobain’s suicide. Fugazi were
certainly aware of Nirvana and may have met Kurt Cobain in person on a
number of occasions, as well as being part of an extended scene of bands
and musicians. They would have had shared interests and friends in
common. They would probably have been affected by his death.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If baby boomer cultural dominance was like a dam holding back the
generation after it, that dam finally burst the day of Nevermind’s
release in September of 1991. At the time, Fugazi was on tour in
Australia promoting Steady Diet of Nothing. “It was like our record
could have been a hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it
had,” says Guy Picciotto. “Nevermind was so huge, and people were so
fucking blown away. We were just like, ‘What the fuck is going on here?’
It was so crazy. On one hand, the shows were bigger, but on the other
hand, it felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of
the disparity of the impact of what they did.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-azerrad2012">Azerrad

</blockquote>
<p>Forensic Scene is one of several songs on Red Medicine that have
related themes:</p>
<ul><li>
</li></ul>
<p>The lyrics are cryptic enough to make the song flexible and open to
other interpretations as well. Several discussions of the song have
characterized it as being about the break-up of a relationship, for
instance <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wright">Wright and Berman
2020</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gathy">Gathy
2025</a>)</span>. In 1995 at Vassar College Walker Fieldhouse,
Poughkeepsie, NY, Guy gave the following introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you ever have a couple of days where like everything you do is
some incredibly stupid-ass mistake? Well, I’ve had a couple of days like
that and this is a song for me, called Forensic Scene. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1995a">Fugazi

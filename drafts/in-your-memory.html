<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Forensic Scene was played live for the first time at Colégio Leão
XIII in Itaboraí, RJ, Brazil on 19 August 1994 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1994">Fugazi 1994</a>)</span>,
introduced by Guy with the comment “you’re probably going to hate this
song but we’re going to play it anyway”. The song got it’s official
release on Red Medicine which was released around the 12 May 1995 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1995">Fugazi 1995</a>)</span>. It
was one of the later songs to debut that would be released on
Repeater.</p>

<p>Fugazi played Forensic Scene at least 201 times with the last
recorded version being on the 4 November 2002 in London, England - the
final Fugazi show to date. It was the 5th most played song from Red
Medicine. In live shows Forensic Scene tended to be used later in the
set, it was often followed by Promises (31 times) or by Long Division
(21 times).</p>
<p>There are several interviews where Guy Picciotto has commented on the
song. In 1995 he only commented in outline:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t normally discuss what songs are actually specifically about.
I feel like that the work that was put into creating the song is the
expression and that people who listen to the song, if they’re interested
in the song, create their own interpretations. I feel like, if it
doesn’t make any sense, then I didn’t succeed when I wrote the song. I’m
willing to accept that as a failure, but in general… Sometimes I’ll
discuss a song like Cassavetes on In on the Kill Taker. I can say that
that’s a song about the filmmaker John Cassavetes, because it seems to
be fairly obvious, but Forensic scene… It’s like a less… It’s a more
personal song. You can’t say that it’s about a specific person or
something like that. It’s more about a situation. And I think it’s up to
people to figure it out for themselves. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mackaye1995">MacKaye and Picciotto 1995</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a 2025 interview with Brian Gathy for the End on End podcast he
went into more detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brendan actually wrote the verse chords and I wrote the chorus
chords… the verse chords seem simple but it’s actually a very
complicated thing. Brendan writes some very complicated guitar shit. His
chordings are so wild and it’s one of my favourite things that he ever
wrote. The pleasure of learning to play that and then figuring out how
to sing to it and then coming up with some big chorus … it’s one of my
favourite things that Brendan and I worked on together, and it really
came from those initial chordings that Brendan came up with, that are so
interesting.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-picciotto2025">Picciotto 2025</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a very sad moment that produced that song, I don’t really have
anything more specific to say to it than that, … it was kind of like
that forensic analysis post-fact of the horrible thing that had just
happened, that’s kind of like what it was.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-picciotto2025">Picciotto 2025</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first time the song was recorded live, in August 1994, it was
fully formed with both lyrics and music being more or less identical to
the studio version that would be recorded in early 1995. This strongly
suggests it had been written, rehearsed and possibly performed live some
time earlier. The 1993 Japan / Australia / New Zealand Tour ended in
Honolulu, Hawaii on the 14 December 1993 and the next show after that
was Brendan’s Going Away Party at Pirate House on 3 June 1994 (no
recording exists). After that Brendan went to live in Seattle for
several months, which means Forensic Scene was probably written sometime
between December 1993 and May 1994. What happened in that time period
that could be described as a ‘horrible thing’ and might have prompted
the composition of this song? One event in particular comes to mind. To
this day I remember where I was when I heard the news, which even on the
first telling involved some forensic details - it stuck in my mind that
they had to identify him from his fingerprints.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NIRVANA SINGER FOUND DEAD By Richard Harrington and Richard Lei.
April 9, 1994. Kurt Cobain, who led the grunge band Nirvana to
superstardom yet reviled his own success, was found shot in the head in
his Seattle home yesterday, an apparent suicide. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-harrington1994">Harrington and Leiby
1994</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are other possible interpretations. Several discussions of the
song have characterized it as being about the break-up of a relationship
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wright">Wright and Berman,
n.d.</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gathy">Gathy,
n.d.</a>)</span>. Both of these discussions were prior to Guy
Picciotto’s most recent remarks, which strongly suggest that it is about
something much more unpleasant than a break-up.</p>
<p>Patrick Foster’s 1995 review of Red Medicine linked the song to the
O.J. Simpson trial but this is clearly impossible because the trial took
place in 1995 and the song was already being performed live in August
1994.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Forensic Scene” is driven by disgust at the circuslike O.J. Simpson
trial, its singsong, nearly Lennonesque vocal fraught with hold-release
momentum. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-foster1995">Foster
1995</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<div id="title" class="section level2">
<h2>Title</h2>
<p>The American Academy of Forensic Sciences has this to say about the
word ‘forensic’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word forensic comes from the Latin word forensis: public, to the
forum or public discussion; argumentative, rhetorical, belonging to
debate or discussion. A relevant, modern definition of forensic is:
relating to, used in, or suitable to a court of law. Any science used
for the purposes of the law is a forensic science. … Forensic scientists
may be involved anytime an objective, scientific analysis is needed to
find the truth and to seek justice in a legal proceeding. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-aafs2022">AAFS 2022</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Scene’ has several possible meanings <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-merriam-webster2008">Merriam-Webster 2008</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>one of the subdivisions of a play</p></li>
<li><p>a stage setting, or a real / imaginary view suggesting a stage
setting</p></li>
<li><p>the place of an occurrence or action</p></li>
<li><p>an exhibition of anger or indecorous behavior</p></li>
<li><p>a sphere of activity or situation</p></li>

<p>The lyrics from the studio recording will be referred to here <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fugazi1995">Fugazi 1995</a>)</span> -
there are some variations in live recordings. The lyric sheet uses all
lower case with no line breaks, here I’m going to use lower case and
line breaks based on how it is sung.</p>

## Repeatr R package

The Repeatr package can be installed from RStudio using the following command:

The package gives easy access to the functions, dataframes, and related documentation.

## Fugazetteer web app

A web app that presents some of the data from the Repeatr package with interactive controls can be found [here](https://alexmitrani.shinyapps.io/Fugazetteer/).

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [Fugazi](https://www.dischord.com/band/fugazi) for everything. The initial data was provided by Ian James Wright of the [Alphabetical Fugazi podcast](https://the-alphabetical-fugazi.pinecast.co/), who got it from Carni Klirs who did the project [Visualizing the History of Fugazi](https://www.carniklirs.com/project/fugazi). An early version of the coordinates and tour data came from [The D-I-Y Data of Fugazi](https://github.com/mathisonian/diy-data-fugazi) by Matthew Conlen. I completely revised and replaced all of the coordinates with more detailed data on the location of each show, but I am nevertheless grateful for the initial data which got me started. Many thanks to all those who answered my questions about where venues were located many years ago - several of the venues would not be in the right place on the map without you!   

## That is all for now

I hope you have found this interesting. If you have any comments or suggestions please add an issue to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexmitrani/Repeatr/).

Thanks.

## Repeatr R package

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [Fugazi](https://www.dischord.com/band/fugazi) for everything.
The initial data was provided by Ian James Wright of the [Alphabetical
Fugazi podcast](https://the-alphabetical-fugazi.pinecast.co/), who got
it from Carni Klirs who did the project [Visualizing the History of
Fugazi](https://www.carniklirs.com/project/fugazi). An early version of
the coordinates and tour data came from [The D-I-Y Data of
Fugazi](https://github.com/mathisonian/diy-data-fugazi) by Matthew
Conlen. I completely revised and replaced all of the coordinates with
more detailed data on the location of each show, but I am nevertheless
grateful for the initial data which got me started. Many thanks to all
those who answered my questions about where venues were located many
years ago - several of the venues would not be in the right place on the
map without you!

## That is all for now

I hope you have found this interesting.

Thanks.
